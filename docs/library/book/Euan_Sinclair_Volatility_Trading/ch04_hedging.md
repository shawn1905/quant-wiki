### CHAPTER 4

e saw in Chapter 1 that the idea of hedging is central to the BSM framework. The concept of hedging was used in the derivation of the BSM equation and it is necessary to hedge to remove exposure to the return of the underlying. To isolate our volatility exposure we need to hedge. Professional option traders are well aware of this. However, the actual process of hedging causes confusion and is subject to several misconceptions. There is an old saying that any option trade can be profitable if only it is hedged correctly. If hedging is thought of as part of the option trading process, and not as a completely unrelated trading strategy, this is simply untrue. While it is possible that some traders have a special ability to trade the underlying, this is not even the point of hedging. Hedging is about mitigating risk so that we can profit from our prediction of volatility. On average, a trade will not make money unless we sell implied volatility higher than realized volatility or buy it lower. Due to the dispersion of trade outcomes around this outcome, enough trades that were based on an incorrect volatility prediction will be winners to keep some traders convinced that this is not true. That is okay. They are wrong—and in a zero sum game, having some participants mistaken about a fundamental aspect of trading can only help the rest of us. Even if a trader can profitably trade both volatility and the direction of the underlying, he should not forget the fact that these are two separate strategies. Further, even the best directional traders will not always have a view on the underlying, while an option trader always needs a hedging plan. In this chapter we devise such a plan.

If we could trade the underlying in any size we wanted and without incurring any costs, we should do so and continuously adjust our stock position to remain delta-neutral. As we saw in Chapter 1, this would make our profit a function of the difference between the implied volatility and the realized volatility. However, in the real world we can only trade in discrete size, and each trade costs us money in commissions and bid/ask spreads. This makes continuously adjusting delta impractical. There are proofs that rely on mathematical properties of GBM to show that the continuous replication demanded by the BSM model incurs infinite transaction costs over any time period, no matter how small. But there is a further problem: When the underlying has a discrete bid/ask spread we can never actually have a flat delta position anyway. Our gamma will cause us to have different deltas when valued against the bid or the offer. So in this case our delta will change even when the underlying isn’t going anywhere. Hedging this bid/ask bounce would incur costs while removing no risk. It is hard to overstate the importance of hedging cheaply and efficiently. Replication risks due to imperfect hedging can easily exceed the anticipated profits from the perceived implied volatility mispricing. Transaction costs from hedging can be large. They are also easy to ignore, as they accumulate progressively over the lifetime of the trade and are not easily perceived by traders, who tend to become focused on short-term results. To see the extent of the issue, consider the following example. We are short one thousand vega of at-the-money options on a stock initially priced at $100 which have one year until expiry. Actual volatility is 40 percent and we sold the position at an implied volatility of 50 percent. Before any costs, we expect to make a profit of $10,000 if we hold it until expiry. However, the bid/ask spread in the underlying is $0.1. Table 4.1 shows the total expected profit for this position if we hedge to a delta-neutral position at various frequencies. (These numbers were the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of this situation, where we looked at the average result of 10,000 realizations of this situation.)

AD HOC HEDGING METHODS Traders use a number of different methods for deciding when to rebalance their hedge. Long after option pricing was considered a science, hedging was still thought of as an art and as a result early hedging theories were somewhat ad hoc.

Hedging at Regular Intervals One of the simplest hedging strategies is to hedge at fixed time intervals. At the end of each time period we execute an underlying trade that sets our delta to zero (or as close to it as possible after allowing for discrete trading units). This practice is sometimes employed by large facilitation desks that may have option positions in several hundred underlyings. At the end of each day the delta for each underlying is flattened. This is simple to understand and implement, but it is totally arbitrary in the choice of time interval. Obviously hedging more often decreases risk. Equally obviously hedging less often decreases costs. It should also be clear that a one-week option should be hedged differently to a one-year option. A day in the life of a one-week option is far more significant than a day in the life of a one-year option.

Hedging to a Delta Band This is a strategy commonly used by market makers or traders who trade only a few products. Here we choose a fixed delta that we are able to tolerate. When our delta exceeds this we hedge. We need to somehow choose the size of the band. Generally this is done by considering the dollar risk we are exposed to by an unhedgeable gap move in the underlying, such as an opening price jump. This could also depend on the sign of the gamma in the portfolio. We may decide to be looser in our hedging if we are long because an adverse move will be partially insured by the gamma. Having to make this choice isn’t necessarily a problem—we will see that such choices are inevitable. The problem is that the choice should be dependent on the option position rather than fixed. This method relies on ad hoc adjustments to achieve this.

Hedging Based on Underlying Price Changes When using this strategy the trader rebalances the delta after the underlying has moved by a certain amount. This is based on the sensible idea that the risk in the portfolio is due to underlying moves, so these should form
the basis for rebalancing decisions. However, we are still left searching for a method that tells us how to choose the appropriate price change. Traders also need to decide whether to calibrate the method based on percentage changes, dollar changes, technical levels of importance, or implied or historical standard deviations.

UTILITY-BASED METHODS We know that hedging is a trade-off between reducing risk and incurring costs. When economists deal with such compromises they often turn to the concept of utility. This gives us the necessary framework for deciding between different alternatives.

Utility Theory Imagine you are given a choice between receiving a certain amount of money or taking a bet which has a 50 percent chance of winning $100 and a 50 percent chance of winning nothing. Clearly the bet has an expected value of $50. If you would rather receive a certain payoﬀ of less than $50 you are risk averse. If you would take $50 you are risk-neutral. If you would only accept more than $50 you are risk-seeking. The certain amount that you would settle for is the called the certainty equivalent. If we plot a graph of certainty equivalent as a function of the bet size we can visualize our utility function. For a risk-averse trader the utility curve will have downward curvature. This means that the utility of a given amount of money is greater than the amount of money itself. This can be seen in Figure 4.1. Conversely, the utility function for a risk-seeking

### Utility

### FIGURE 4.1 The Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Trader
trader curves upwards. The utility of a given amount of money is less than the amount of money itself. Such a utility curve is shown in Figure 4.2. The two most important aspects of (sensible) utility functions for a trader are that they slope up because we prefer more money to less, and they curve downward because we become more risk-averse when larger amounts are involved. We can quantify our risk aversion by using the Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion, which is deﬁned by r=

U  (W) U  (W)

### (4.1)

A commonly used utility function is the exponential utility function. It has the functional form U (W) = − exp(−γ W)

### (4.2)

It is unique in having constant absolute risk aversion as r = γ is independent of the wealth, W . Let’s look at an example to see how we would ﬁnd our risk tolerance. We do this by asking questions about the certainty equivalents of risky outcomes that are normally distributed. Suppose the distribution of future wealth has a mean µ and a standard deviation σ . For example, µ = $10,000 and σ = $2,000.

So the certainty equivalent, W0 , is given by W0 = µ −

### (4.5)

This can be inverted to give an expression for the risk aversion, λ. γ =

2 (µ − W0 ) σ2

### (4.6)

Now suppose that the trader is indiﬀerent between this distribution of wealth and a certain outcome of $8,000; that is, W0 = $8,000. Here γ =

2 (10, 000 − 8, 000) = 0.001 2, 000 · 2, 000

We can go through this process for various wealth levels and various distributions. Quite a large amount of variability tends to be found. Real traders tend to exhibit little consistency in their risk appetites, either through time or as a function of the amount of the money at stake. Many behavioral ﬁnance studies directly address this point (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Barberis et al. 2001). For this and other reasons, the use of utility functions in economics has been subject to criticism (Mirowski 1989; McCauley 2004). This needn’t overly concern us. As with our use of the BSM model, utility is just a framework for us to think within. While a trader may never speciﬁcally know his utility function and while his risk aversion may change, it isn’t unreasonable to state that he prefers more to less and is risk-averse. This is all we really need.

Hodges and Neuberger (1989) recognized that as BSM really prices the replication strategy rather than the option directly, they could do the same thing but incorporating transaction costs. Actually, including transaction costs was first done by Leland (1985) but, while his results led to pricing the option with a modified volatility to allow for the costs of hedging, we still need to continuously adjust the hedge. So this doesn’t address the practical problem of when best to hedge. The most important idea in Hodges and Neuberger’s paper is that there comes a point where the option trader is indifferent (in the utility sense)
to holding the risk associated with the mis-hedged option and the cost associated with hedging it. If we can specify our level of risk aversion, this strategy is optimal. They formulated the problem in terms of maximizing the exponential utility function, but it was subsequently proved (Davis et al. 1993; Andersen and Damgaard 1999) that the results are basically independent of the precise form of the utility function. As mentioned in the accompanying box on utility, we would be justified in being suspicious of any result that didn’t have this property. The mathematics required to formulate the problem are beyond the scope of this book. Sadly, the resulting valuation equation has no analytic solution and needs to be solved numerically. Even this is not easy. The required computations are prohibitively time consuming. There is no practical way to use the Hodges-Neuberger (HN) methodology as a real-time hedging guide. But because it is the optimal solution, its properties are important to understand. Figures 4.3 and 4.4 show the hedging bandwidth for a long call position and a short call position. When our position’s delta moves outside the band, we hedge to bring our delta back to the edge of the band. (This is only true if we assume that the counterparty in an option trade has no ability to predict the direction of the underlying. There is some evidence that option customers are partially informed. In this case we should immediately hedge the delta of any new option trade to the BSM delta. However, subsequent delta rehedging would follow the HN scheme and we would only hedge if we moved outside the bands. It probably wouldn’t be wise to overhedge the original trade to achieve the same directional risk as the counterparty, unless you had a very clear idea of the magnitude and duration of the customer’s directional trading ability.

extensive analysis.) The parameters chosen are not particularly realistic but have been chosen to exaggerate the properties of the solution. We chose the case of a one-year option with volatility of 0.3, transaction costs of 2 percent, zero interest and carry rates, and a risk aversion of one Several points are immediately obvious. First of all, the short and long positions need to be hedged differently. The band for the short position is narrower. So we hedge our short positions more defensively. We have time decay on our side so we take less chance with delta, whereas when we are hedging long positions we need to let our deltas run. Interestingly, this is in accordance with trader folklore. Another way to see why this should be so is to note that the hedger of a long position sees a different level of volatility to that seen by the hedger of a short position. As the underlying reaches a new high, a short gamma hedger will be inclined to buy. In doing so, he will make the high even higher by paying the offer. In contrast, a seller sells at the bid, slightly lower than the high. The cumulative effect of crossing bid/ask like this means that the long and short positions have different volatility levels to contend with. This was the central result of Leland’s. He showed that the adjusted volatility for a long option position was   λ (4.7) σ̂ = σ 1 − σ π t where λ is the proportional transaction cost t is the time between rebalancing

For a short option position, the adjusted volatility is   λ σ̂ = σ 1 + σ π t

(4.8)

While we do not explicitly use Leland’s results to determine our hedging strategy, these are very important results. Before doing any option trade, we need to be aware approximately how much edge will be eroded by cumulative delta hedging. This effect can be considerable, particularly for low-volatility, illiquid stocks. For example, if fair volatility is 10 percent and the bid/ask spread is 1 percent, an option that is rehedged daily would need to be sold at an implied volatility of over 15.9 percent to account for this. Additionally, the optimal delta band does not span the BSM delta. A perfectly hedged portfolio in the BSM world may need to be adjusted when transaction costs are present. This is also consistent with Leland’s observation because if an out-of-the-money call sees a higher volatility, due to the dependency of the option’s delta on volatility, it acts like it has a higher delta. Similarly, an in-the-money option acts like it has a lower delta. This causes the hedging band to be centered around an S-shaped modified delta, rather than the BSM delta. The preceding analysis was done for European options but the general idea can be extended to cover American options. This is similar to the BSM model, where the partial differential equation is general but the methods used to solve it are dependent on the exact boundary conditions. This caveat also applies to the other models we look at. We can normally expect the results for American options to be similar to those obtained for European options (in most cases Americans can be thought of as Europeans). Not evident from Figures 4.3 and 4.4, but the essential feature of the model, is that the width of the hedging band is dependent on the risk aversion. A large risk-aversion parameter means that the trader wants to accept little risk. So he wants tight hedging bands and will hedge often. Conversely, a trader with a small risk-aversion parameter will be prepared to hedge less frequently, accepting risk to reduce hedging costs. Neither of these choices is more correct than the other. As with all hedging methods, we need to decide how risk-averse we are. But given this choice, the HN formalism gives us the optimal balance between risk and reward.

The Asymptotic Solution of Whalley and Wilmott If we assume that the transaction costs are small (relative to the value of the option in the BSM world), it is possible to derive some approximate solutions to the full problem. This was first done by Whalley and Wilmott
(1997). They show that the boundaries of the no-transaction regions are given by ∂V ± = ∂S

where λ is the proportional transaction cost—that is, transaction costs are of the form tc = λ |N| S

### (4.10)

where N is the total number of shares traded Although the authors considered the case of hedging a short position in a European call option, the method is far more general: It can be applied to the hedging of general portfolios. The solution has a number of pleasingly sensible aspects. An example of the resulting hedging bands is shown in Figure 4.5. This was for the case of a one-year option with volatility of 0.3, transaction costs of 2 percent, zero interest and carry rates, and a risk aversion of one.

r As transaction costs decrease, the hedging bandwidth decreases. Indeed, as costs go to zero, the BSM delta is recovered.

r As risk aversion increases, the hedging bandwidth decreases, as in the full HN theory.

r The strategy can be reduced to an analytical formula, which makes implementing it in Excel feasible. 0.9 0.8 0.7 Bands

r The method can also deal with transaction costs with different structures. In particular it can handle transaction costs proportional to the number of shares, as opposed to being proportional to the value of the shares as in equation (4.10). Ticket charges and brokerage are examples of such costs. And it is a matter of some debate whether the bid/ask spread (the dominant cost) should be modeled this way. We address this later in this chapter. The model can also accommodate the generally unrealistic situation where the costs are a single fixed charge. This might be the case if there is a very high trade cost that is set irrespective of the size of the trade. This would possibly impact a retail customer but will not be relevant to even a semiprofessional. The Whalley and Wilmott (WW) method also has some unfortunate aspects:

r The asymmetry of long and short gamma positions that came out of the full HN solution is lost. Only the magnitude of gamma is relevant to the asymptotic solution. r The hedging band is now centered on the BSM delta, losing another feature of the full HN solution. A problem can arise in practice. If a trader sees an underlying get choppy or start whipping around, it isn’t always obvious whether he should adjust the bid/ask spread or increase the volatility. To the trader these have the same primary impact: They both make hedging more difficult. However, the effect in these models (HN and WW) is very different. For an at-themoney option, increasing the volatility will lower the gamma, which leads to a tighter hedging band. But increasing the bid/ask spread (the proportional transaction cost) leads to a wider hedging band. How do we deal with this important practical issue? The discrepancy is caused by the fact that these models explicitly incorporate risk aversion. Volatility is a traded quantity. It contains both risk and reward. When volatility is high these models tell us to fear the worst and hedge often. But the bid/ask spread is purely a cost. It has no rewarding aspects. If the bid/ask spread is wide, the models tell us to hold off hedging to avoid multiple whipsaw losses.1 The trader needs to consider this and think carefully about what aspect of the market is really changing. Volatility isn’t the same as transaction costs at all (even a perfect, frictionless market has volatility), but they can look the same at first glance.

This helpful explanation is from Johnny at www.nuclearphynance.com.

While not really feasible in many market situations, it is possible to separately statistically estimate transaction costs and volatility. Transaction costs can be estimated by keeping track of the difference between our execution price and the previous trade. It is completely a microstructure issue (although what constitutes microstructure can vary between traders; Fidelity will have a very different view of transaction costs than a market maker standing in the crude oil pit at the NYMEX).Volatility can be estimated by using a time period that includes a large number of trades of a size relevant to the particular trader. Just as with the BSM model, these hedging schemes should not be thought of as true models of reality. They just give a consistent and systematic framework for dealing with the world. This particular issue emphasizes this fact.

The Double Asymptotic Method of Zakamouline The two relatively simple transaction cost models are those of Leland and Whalley and Wilmott. They can both be viewed as special cases of the Hodges and Neuberger model: Leland describes how to replicate an option in the presence of transaction costs when we are risk-neutral; Whalley and Wilmott incorporate risk aversion but insist on the costs being small. While these models are simple to apply and use, and will almost certainly be an improvement over more ad hoc methods, they lose some of the appealing aspects of the full HN model. More crucially, careful numerical simulations show that the approximations can significantly underperform the full strategy—in other words, for a given level of transaction costs, a portfolio hedged with the WW model will experience more variance than one hedged according to the HN model. (This isn’t really a criticism. It should be obvious that an approximation won’t perform as well as the full model.) Zakamouline (2006a, b, and c) examined the stylized facts of the nature of the utility-based hedging strategies (essentially the bullet points in the preceding section) and proposed a functional form for a hedging strategy that preserved the most important features; this was also proposed independently by Risher (2004). The hedging bands take the form =

∂ V (σm) ± (H1 + H0 ) ∂S

### (4.11)

Immediately we can see that instead of being centered on the BSM delta, it is based on the BSM delta evaluated at the modified volatility, σ m . σm2 = σ 2 (1 − K)

### (4.12)
H 1 will be a gamma dependent term, similar in effect to that in the WW model. The exact numerical solution of the HN model shows that even for very far out-of-the-money options (with practically no gamma), the width of the hedging band does not go to zero. This feature is not captured by the WW model. This means that we need to introduce the H 0 term. Zakamouline postulated the functional form of the solution and then used numerical analysis to fit the parameters. The results were H0 =

An example of the resulting hedging bands is shown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7. These were for the case of a one-year option with volatility of 0.3, transaction costs of 2 percent, zero interest and carry rates, and a risk aversion of one. As can be seen from Figures 4.6 and 4.7, Zakamouline’s method gives results that look much closer to the HN result than those of WW. In particular the middle of the no-transaction region does not coincide with the BSM delta. This comes about from using a modified hedging volatility.

Before we can compare the various strategies we need some sort of common benchmark. The strategies don’t all do the same thing. Some are based on time increments and some are based on price moves. For example, consider the regular time interval rebalancing method. First we choose a time period; then we perform a simulation and compute the risk and return of the strategy. Then we vary the time interval and repeat the process. Eventually we will obtain an efficient frontier for the strategy. We do this for each strategy and compare the frontiers. This lets us find the best strategy (in return terms) for a given level of risk. For return we choose the replication error: the total effect of all of the transaction costs. For risk we choose the variance of the replication error. This means we evaluate risk in the familiar mean-variance framework, but other risk measures are certainly valid (refer to Chapter 7 for a discussion of the strengths and drawbacks of some of these measures). Simulations of this type were carried out by Zakamouline (2005, 2006b) and Martellini and Priaulet (2002). Zakamouline simulated the hedging of a short position in a one-year call option. The time hedging intervals varied from 1.25 (trading) days to 50 days. The parameters of the other models were chosen so that the final results were all in a similar part of the mean-variance surface. (This is similar to how a trader would use the models. He would calibrate a new hedging model by saying, “Currently my hedging strategy leaves me with X amount of risk. If I have the new model leave me with the same amount of risk, how much money do I save?”) Numerical simulations show that Zakamouline’s approximation clearly dominates the others. By this we mean that for a given level of risk, the
strategy costs the least to implement. Ideally we would like one strategy to dominate for all levels of risk. This doesn’t completely happen. The relative quality of the different strategies is dependent on the level of risk aversion and the level of transaction costs. A further consideration when choosing a hedging strategy is that not all are equally easy to implement. The Hodges-Neuberger scheme is at one extreme in that it is the optimal solution but practically impossible to use. The Zakamouline scheme is a better approximation to this ideal than is the Wilmott-Whalley method, but it is also more difficult to use in practice as some trading software doesn’t easily facilitate its implementation (in particular, the change in delta with respect to volatility is not calculated by all systems). Another complication is that an option position will often have a gamma profile that changes sign as a function of the underlying. For example, consider the long butterfly position consisting of long a 90 percent call, short two 100 percent calls and long one 110 percent call. This has the payoff shown in Figure 4.8. Imagine that we managed to somehow enter this position for zero cost. We are now in the fantastic situation of having a position that can only make money—but only if we do not continuously hedge it! If the underlying fluctuates between the 90 percent and 110 percent strikes we will always be short gamma, and if we hedge the deltas that we accumulate, buying high and selling low, we can easily lose money. This example should tell us two very important things. First, the dynamic hedging strategy needs to take the global gamma profile into account. Second, if we can cheaply work into a static hedge with other options, this is vastly preferable to dynamic hedging with the underlying.

### FIGURE 4.8 The Payoﬀ of a Butterﬂy Spread as a Function of Moneyness
There is a more important point that needs to be made here. As we emphasize throughout this book, it is vital to figure out exactly what one is trying to achieve at any point in the trading process. Specifically, what is the point of hedging? Superficially it is to remove exposure to the direction of the underlying market. More generally it is to remove exposure to risks we do not wish to accept while keeping exposure to those we do. If we are market-making options, our edge comes from collecting the bid/ask spread. To keep as much of this as possible, we should hedge as much of our volatility exposure as we can by trading other options (preferably by collecting the spread on these as well). This is covered as a practical problem in Baird (1992) and Taleb (1997) and in a more formal setting by Carr et al. (1998) and Hua and Wilmott (1999). However, if we explicitly set out to take a position on the spread between realized and implied volatilities, then this will generally not be possible. Dynamic hedging can still leave a lot of risks, but sometimes we actually want to take that risk on. This is not a problem to approach in too dogmatic a manner. It needs to be understood and mitigated to some degree and accepted to some degree. The basic ways to deal with the problem can be summarized as follows.

r Inoculate your volatility bet from the effect of jumps by buying options in the wings if you are short at-the-money options. (If you are long options, you want exposure to jumps.) r Try to diversify jump risk across products. r Size each position to limit total losses. r Don’t base your evaluation of the worst thing that could happen on the worst thing that has happened in the past. If you are selling volatility, part of your premium exists because you are selling insurance premium for events that have never happened before.

ESTIMATION OF TRANSACTION COSTS The fixed components of trading costs for any underlying trade are trivial to figure out. They consist of any brokerage, exchange, and clearing fees. More difficult are the proportional transaction costs, which are heavily dominated by the bid/ask spread. If we are trading small enough this will be equal to half the quoted bid/ask spread. This is likely to be the case for individual traders trading interest rate products or indexes. However, we will always reach a size where the market impact of the trade will significantly alter the price we receive from the one that we saw quoted when we first started to hedge. Generally, market depth looks something like that shown in Table 4.2 and Figure 4.9, where there is something like a V-shaped distribution for

But what we actually see at any time in the order book is unlikely to be the actual total share quantity that we could trade. For example, we see that if we went to the market to buy 1,000 Merrill Lynch shares we would be filled at an average of 75.475 (200 at 75.44, 500 at 75.45, and 300 at 75.54) but in reality we would often be filled better, for two reasons. First, we are only seeing resting limit orders in the book. If we were to split our order into smaller blocks and execute these separately, our buying would be likely to induce new selling orders to enter the market (in theory, that is

what a specialist is supposed to do). But of increasing relevance is the issue of dark liquidity.2 There are a number of algorithms, formerly the preserve of fairly sophisticated algorithmic trading hedge funds but now available to most institutional traders, that won’t show the entire trade to the market at once. A simple example is the iceberg order. Say we wanted to buy 1,000 Merrill Lynch. An iceberg might buy the 700 offered up to 75.44 and then bid 75.44 on 100. If we are filled on this bid, the system automatically bids 75.44 for another 100 until our total order is filled. This type of order is named iceberg because at any point we only see the tip of the order, most of it remaining hidden. So we need to estimate market impact transaction costs as a function of order size. Just looking at the current market is not enough. Similar to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in quantum physics, our interaction with the market changes the market. We need a fairly robust way of measuring the effect of this interaction. This problem is one that is still an active area of research in market microstructure, but we will present a simple yet powerful model that captures many aspects of the situation, is easy to use, and is a good starting point for any further research. This form of market impact analysis was first proposed at Merrill Lynch (Gatheral 2001). As is fairly obvious to anyone with any experience at all in markets, trades do not occur at constant intervals. To simplify the mathematics, let’s assume we can make a change of timescale so that they do occur at equal intervals (this transformation will never be knowable in reality, but conceptually we can make a change to this new time—trading time). Now the number of trades in any interval, N t , is Poisson distributed with a constant parameter λ. So in this timescale the expected number of trades, λ, per trading time is constant. If the stock is busy, trading time flows quickly. If the stock is quiet then trading time is slow. (The Poisson distribution is illustrated in Figure 4.10. Note that the distribution is only defined for integer values of k and the connective lines were only added to help visualize the shape.) The market impact, F(n), is defined as the amount the log midprice of the underlying changes due to a trade of n shares. Or  ln S =

For a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, we have E [Nt ] = V ar [Nt ] = λt

### (4.17)

So V ar [ ln S] = E [Nt ] V ar [F (ni )] + V ar [Nt ] E [F (ni )]2 = λt E [F(n)t ]2

### (4.18)

A number of researchers have concluded that market impact scales as the square root of the trade size (Hasbrouck 1991; Madhavan and Smidt 1991; BARRA 1997). √ F (n) = α n

### (4.19)

where α is some constant, the market impact parameter. Substituting this into equation (4.18) we obtain V ar [ ln S] = α 2 λt E [ni ] = α 2 µt

### (4.20)

where µ is defined as the number of shares traded per unit of trading time The time change to trading time was designed to make this quantity constant. So this equation also says that the variance of returns per unit of trading time is also constant. Now we imagine that we undo our original time shift. This means that both the volatility (σ t ) and µt , the number of shares traded per unit of actual time, will be random variables. Eliminating

the common factor of t (refer to equation 4.18) we obtain σt2 = α 2 µt

### (4.21)

This gives a straightforward relationship between volume and volatility. This has been confirmed in numerous studies (Clark 1973; Tauchen and Pitts 1983; Karpoff 1987), and few traders will dispute the relationship (although they will argue over whether volume causes volatility or vice versa). This model also leaves unsettled the dispute over whether trading time is measured in number of trades or in volume of shares. Here, the choices are equivalent. Equation (4.22) gives us a simple way to estimate the market impact. σt α=√ µt

### (4.22)

We know how to estimate the volatility. All we need to measure now is the volume of stock traded per unit of time. Strengths r The model is very simple to understand and estimate. r The model fits our basic intuition: The more activity there is in a stock, the less our market impact will be. r We don’t need to deal with data at the level of individual transactions. r This model can be used as a framework in the same way that we use BSM and the hedging models in Chapter 1. We can tune it to each individual market by multiplying by a prefactor. For example, we might find that DAX stocks are more slippery than FTSE stocks. (Merrill Lynch calculated a list of these prefactors. I don’t include these here because they are probably obsolete and they were estimated by asking Merrill Lynch traders. I think, but cannot prove, that they reflect the attitudes of individual traders as much as any fundamental aspect of each market. This is probably a place where the skill of a good, attentive trader can make a significant difference to overall performance.) Weaknesses r The model does not allow for sales to produce a different market impact to buys. r The model doesn’t take account of the market maker’s inventory, which in practice has a large effect on the market impact of any particular order.

AGGREGATION OF OPTIONS ON DIFFERENT UNDERLYINGS As we saw at the start of this chapter, the best way to reduce our hedging cost is to hedge less often. If we are trading options on a number of different underlyings, there is a chance that many of our delta risks will offset. If we are prepared to accept correlation risk instead, we can use this to avoid hedging by aggregating our deltas and hedging market and possibly sector risks in index products. Generally there is a trade-off here. An index position is not going to be as good a hedge against our single stock option positions as the stocks themselves would be, but we will save on transaction costs because we will only need to hedge residual risk, not every individual risk. The process of aggregation is simple enough in principle. Consider the example where we have a stock A with price SA = 100, and an index I with price SI = 1,000. Also assume that the index has an exchange-traded fund (ETF) associated with it, so all of the trading units are comparable. Stock A has a beta relative to the index, β = 1.5. This means that if the index moves up 1 percent, A moves by 1.5 percent. If we are long 1,000 deltas of A (whether shares or through option deltas) and the index moves 1 percent, our profit/loss ratio (P/L) is given by P/L = $0.01 × β × SA × 1,000 = $15 × SA = $1,500 And for each unit of the index ETF we hold short, our loss will be P/L = −$0.01 × 1000 = $10 So to be hedged we need to hold a short position of 150 ETFs. Equivalently, our delta in terms of the ETF is given by I = β

Vega can be normalized in the same way as delta, but to do this we need to know the volatility beta. This could be determined empirically by regressing changes in the stock’s implied volatility on changes in index volatility, but this is likely to give a very noisy and probably nonsensical result. An alternative would be to assume that changes in implied volatility and realized volatility are correlated perfectly (not a great assumption but not the worst one to start with, either) and then use the result that the volatility beta is the same as beta. To see this, start from the definition of variance given by equation (2.1b). 2  1  SA (t) ln N SA (t − 1) 1  ≈ dSA2 N 1   2 2 = β dSI N ≈ β 2 σ I2

(Of course, if we defined β to be the slope of the regression of logarithmic returns of the stock to logarithmic returns of the index, this relationship would be exactly true instead of just a very good approximation.) This tells how we could normalize our option positions. It is more of a judgment call whether we should normalize them. It really comes down to weighing the benefits from reduced hedging costs against the errors introduced by misestimation and the generally unstable nature of the beta factors. Generally, estimating and forecasting beta is even more difficult than forecasting volatility (as we have to effectively estimate two volatilities and a correlation). When trading options speculatively, we think that we have an edge in volatility prediction over the market. It probably isn’t wise to conflate this bet with a more difficult one when trying to save hedging costs, but this trade-off is highly dependent on the particular situation. It is probably unwise not to aggregate the Greeks from bills, notes, and bonds, but whether to aggregate the risks from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google

(GOOG) into a NASDAQ book is more of a questionable call. Traders who are serious about going down this path may want to consider using one of the commercially developed factor models such as BARRA or APT to quantify their risks. The more conservative method would be to come up with hedging bands for each underlying, and then also to keep track of the entire position’s risk in terms of an index or possibly several indexes. This can help protect us against the situation where the whole market moves against us but none of our individual positions has reached a point where it should be hedged.

SUMMARY To trade volatility we need to continuously monitor, and periodically adjust, our underlying position. Exactly how we choose to do this will have a huge effect on our overall profitability. Most of the trading that an option trader does is actually hedging, so it is important to understand the process.

r Remember that hedging is designed to remove risk. If you are trying to trade the underlying directionally you are not hedging.

r Successful hedging removes the most risk for the least cost. r The Hodges-Neuberger formalism solves this problem in theory but is too cumbersome to use in practice.

r The approximation of Zakamouline is a very good working solution that retains most of the desirable features of the HN method.

r The Whalley-Wilmott approximation is a good rough approximation that can be implemented within many commercially available pricing software solutions. r Further cost reduction can be achieved by aggregating option positions across many different underlyings and managing the residual risk. r Dynamic hedging cannot be relied upon. It must be combined with static hedging using other options. Only this can offset the risks associated with jumps.
