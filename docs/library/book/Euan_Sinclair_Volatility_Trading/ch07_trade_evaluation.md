### CHAPTER 7

ogi Berra was alleged to have said, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.” The practical difficulties of implementing our trading ideas will only become obvious, and hence become problems that we can address, if we keep detailed records. It is always important for a trader to track the results of his trades, but it is especially important when using options to trade volatility. We will be using an instrument, an option, to trade a parameter, volatility. As we saw in Chapter 5, it is quite possible to predict realized volatility correctly yet still lose money on the hedged option position because of path dependence. This is not the case when trading stocks or futures. In those cases, if we correctly predict direction we will almost certainly realize a profit. But if we do not carefully keep records of our trades, it will be impossible to decide if we have been lucky or if we have really discovered a source of edge. You need to know exactly how well you have done in order to do things better. Without accurate and comprehensive records it is very easy to fall victim to selective memory biases. We all tend to remember the few big wins and big losses. But these are unlikely to be typical of our trading, and basing decisions on how these trades alone worked out would be very unwise. Trading is largely about making solid, unspectacular plays—precisely the ones that we tend to forget. For each trading idea or strategy we have we should keep a tally of results, even if it is just a minor adjustment like biasing our hedging strategy toward the long side because we are concerned about a stock being a takeover target.

### Y
Many times we hear something like, “It is too hard to know exactly where my profits come from because so many things interact.” Merely stating that the problem is hard is no excuse not to try. Tracking results is not as enjoyable or as glamorous as finding new trades but it is just as essential to a successful operation.

GENERAL PLANNING PROCEDURES It is a good practice to set aside a certain time (for equity options the Monday after expiry is a good time) to go through all aspects of your trading operation. One aspect of orthodox economic theory with which traders should have no problem is that improvements must be made at the margin; we must constantly strive to improve all aspects of our businesses from clearing arrangements to brokerage rates, software, hardware, data feeds, and so on. Make it a set event every month to write down each part of the trading operation and think about whether any aspect could be improved. Generally nothing will come up, but the world changes quickly. In the past year we have changed our execution software, our data feeds, and our hedging strategy. None of these changes would be enough to get excited over on their own, but this process is essential if one wants to stay competitive. During this review we should also establish and review performance benchmarks. Overall performance benchmarking is really in the hands of the capital providers, but during the year it is up to each trader to monitor these and assess progress toward them. It is necessary to establish three levels of achievement: 1. Success. What level of return is necessary for the period to be judged

an unqualified success? 2. Respectability. What return would be deemed adequate but unexceptional? Operating at this level should not lead to much doubt about the overall validity of the trading operation but would indicate that incremental improvements and continuing diligence are necessary. 3. Failure. What level of performance would lead to the operation being stopped out? For example, we might initially set the parameters of a new operation as follows. In the first year we want to make $1 million on an average haircut of $1 million. Returns of between $400,000 and $800,000 would be
acceptable and would give us the go-ahead to continue. If we lost $400,000 we would liquidate all positions and reevaluate the idea. How do we arrive at these goals? After all, it would be wildly unrealistic for a long-only equity trader who is trading a stock with a typical drift of 10 percent per year and an annualized volatility of 30 percent to expect to make a 100 percent return. Before we set our goals, we need to realistically evaluate our own skill and the opportunities available to us. The bottom line is important. At the end of the year, the total net profit will determine how much we get paid. Trading is all about profits. It doesn’t matter what used to happen, what you think should happen, what an analyst tells you is happening, what is in the business pages, or what the talking heads on TV say. It is entirely about making money. However, over a short time period, profitability is a very crude evaluation of how good we are and is also very unlikely to be a good predictor of how well we are likely to perform in the future. Our goals and improvement plans must be based on more discriminating information. Total profit (or loss) can’t tell us how to do better. An athletics coach would not tell his charges to “run faster” and expect them to improve. They already know they need to run faster. They need to know how. In the same way, we know we need to make more money. We also need to know how. So results are all that matter but we can only improve results by focusing on process. There is also a group of traders who are strangely in denial about where their profits come from. For instance, a market maker may be insistent that all of his positions make money or, if he is a little more self-deprecating, that his positions are a scratch. Many beginning traders would rather be right than profitable, and it seems like this is an aspect of the same phenomenon. For some reason, collecting the bid/ask spread or being paid for taking order flow isn’t enough. This attitude can only be a hindrance. If we don’t know where our money comes from we can’t improve our results. For each underlying security we trade, we need to keep records of at least the following information:

r Average daily profit or loss, both gross and net of fees, commissions, and brokerage.

r Haircut being used. r Percentage of days that are winners or losers. r Size of average winning days r Size of average losing days. (Successful trades will tend to have certain similarities. For example, your successful short volatility trades may average 75 percent winning days when held to expiration. Knowing these numbers will also help you avoid stopping yourself out of losing
long volatility positions. How long do you typically need to wait for your predicted explosion?) r Maximum win and loss. This is more a measure of the scariness of the trade. And remember that the largest loss you have seen so far isn’t necessarily as bad as it can get. Can you cope with this? r Cumulative profit and loss of the trade to date. r Maximum drawdown, both magnitude and duration. This captures a path dependency of our profit and loss (P/L) that cannot be seen from just the histogram of the daily returns. It is important to know how many losing days in a row is typical because these are the most trying times to work through. Being able to look at similar periods from the past is very helpful in reassuring yourself that your current misery is really not (necessarily) a sign of doom. Also remember that whenever you are in a drawdown (and you will seldom be at the peak of your equity curve) you are not getting paid. You do not get paid for periods where you are recovering from drawdowns. Only incremental performance counts. So you and your capital providers should be more concerned about drawdowns than any other performance measure. As a very rough rule of thumb, and this is dependent on numerous variables, a 10 percent drawdown will cause marketing issues and a 30 percent drawdown starts to raise questions of survival. However, drawdowns are a fact of life. They are one reason why the money management procedures need to be addressed before trading starts. Being in a hole is always bad, but it is at least nice to have a predetermined plan for getting out. The issue of which costs to include in our analysis deserves some thought. What is the point of this whole exercise? If it is to show customers how their investment in a fund has performed, then all costs and expenses need to be accounted for. But if it is to decide whether a new idea is worth pursuing, then including office expenses doesn’t make a lot of sense. In this case it is important to measure the performance of the driving strategy first. If it succeeds at this level, you can then decide if it fits in with your overall business plan. And between these extremes are a lot of expenses that might or might not be worth including. Would your strategy work if you cancelled your news feed? If not, then you might want to include this cost. Apply common sense and remember your overall goal. Generally the great majority of benefit will be gained by collecting statistics at the daily level. Transaction-level data is often more hassle than it is worth, as most daily trades will be delta hedges. These need to be viewed as part of the overall trade and not as separate transactions. Table 7.1 contains the necessary summary statistics for an IBM trade, and Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 show the evolution of the P/L through time.

Knowing what these numbers are doesn’t make improvements obvious. Sadly, things are not as simple as noting that if 55 percent of our days are winners, we would do better if we were to increase this to 65 percent. Also many of these statistics are interrelated.

position will win on more days than it loses, but its losses will tend to be larger than its wins. But these numbers do provide important information. Seeing how they change over time is important. They can point out the degradation of a strategy more rapidly than raw P/L numbers. They can also provide early signals of style drift. Finally, the more we dissect our results the better. Familiarity with the results of our trading process is very important.

We should be particularly wary of traders who cannot tell us how their profits are actually made. Having solid numbers can also lead us to improve our trading by making clear issues that we didn’t even know existed. You may love trading expiry, and this may have caused you to believe you have a significant edge during that period. But this may be colored by your enjoyment of the busy trading. The numbers will tell you one way or the other. You may actually be better off aggressively flattening your front-month position before expiration and concentrating on implementing new longer-dated trades instead. Also realize that not all people are equally suited to trading all things. Some people need the regular wins that being short volatility can provide, while others are contrary enough to thrive on the long losing periods and huge wins that come from being long volatility. It is often said that a good trader should be equally adept at trading from either the long or the short side. While this might be the ideal, it is very unlikely that this is true of any trader. Finding good longs requires a different thought process to finding good shorts. Furthermore, during any specific time period it is likely that the market has been kinder to one direction than the other. In equity investing there are periods where value dominates growth. This will also apply to volatility trading where, for periods of time, the longs will outperform the shorts. We shouldn’t overreact to this and chase the hot strategy, but it is good to know. Sometimes we just have to stick to our approach and wait for the market to swing back in our favor. As long as you can find value, either way can work. But they are unlikely to work equally well for any individual. Many traders also use a fundamental view as a final consideration before taking a trade, maybe deciding that in the current market environment selling volatility in a mortgage lender is a bad idea, for example. On the one hand it seems obvious that the judgment of an experienced market participant must add value in this regard. On the other hand, how much does a random option trader know about the dynamics of any particular industry beyond what he reads in the papers? Tracking the results of these judgment calls will settle the argument—not just vaguely recalling the big winners and losers, but looking at complete results for all of the trades that were done and also those that were rejected. Seems like too much work? It is a lot of work, but it isn’t too much. It is necessary. Another apparent source of edge that may just be an expensive illusion is working into trades by trying to sell the offer and buy the bid. When this works it is obviously a good thing, but how often does it actually work? How often do you not sell the offer and end up chasing ever lower bids? There is no reason why you cannot quantify this. And since you can, you should.
After each expiration cycle a similar analysis should be done, but this time we view each trade as a single completed event. Here we are not focused on the trades’ temporal evolution, just on its results. At this point trades should be segmented into long volatility and short volatility trades. Each sector should also be broken out. It is quite possible that the approach we have designed, which uses historical data analysis to evaluate prospective trades, is more suitable to some sectors than to others. Sometimes this is obvious. The trading of small biotechnology companies should clearly be a case where the past is only very tangentially related to the future. But sometimes there may be a factor missing in the analysis that isn’t obvious. For example, I have never had much success trading retail stocks. I don’t know what I am missing, but at this point I need to acknowledge that my results are significantly different from those in other sectors and that this is unlikely to be due to luck. If we had not broken down trade results by sector we would never have discovered this fact. These numbers should give us a good place to start in setting our goals. The initial numbers to look at are the daily profit in dollar amounts as a return on the haircut that our clearing firm requires us to put up in collateral to hold the position. The fact that we have an average 1 percent return each day on the used haircut makes this trade seem at least superficially attractive. But a trade’s effectiveness cannot be judged purely on its returns. Risk is also a consideration. Low-risk trades can always be more heavily leveraged to increase return. As a slight aside, do not consider the required haircut to be a measure of risk. This is best thought of as purely a financing requirement. If a trader is trading only a few products or only products with very similar price and volatility characteristics, he may be able to closely associate haircut and risk, but this is generally not the case. For example, it is a common practice in the equity world to calculate the haircut for a short option position based on a 15 percent move in the underlying. This will dramatically overstate the risk of a short volatility position in IBM, which trades at an implied volatility in the teens, and it will dramatically understate the risk associated with a short volatility position in a biotechnology company that trades at an implied volatility of over 100. If you think of haircut as a risk measure, please stop now. It might or might not be a valid way for a clearing firm to manage its business, but it is a terrible way for an option trader to manage his.

RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE MEASURES All measures of risk have weaknesses. Here we look at several of the standard measures. Generally options traders are benchmarked to the return

on cash, so we will ignore measures that compare our performance to other benchmarks.

The Sharpe Ratio This is the ratio of the annualized return over the risk-free rate divided by the volatility (Sharpe 1966). SR =

µ−r σ

### (7.1)

If returns are normally distributed, then this has a relationship to the probability of making a return greater than the risk-free rate. Of course returns are practically never normal. The Sharpe ratio has many well-documented weaknesses. In fact, its weaknesses are so well documented and often referred to, that its considerable strengths are now often overlooked. The fact that it isn’t perfect does not mean it is not useful. Strengths r It is simple, both to calculate and to understand. r It is an intuitively good thing to calculate. It is a ratio of return to risk, and while volatility doesn’t capture all elements of risk it at least captures some. r It is leverage independent so we can compare strategies and traders operating in different spaces. r It is something of an industry standard. The Sharpe ratio is almost to risk what BSM is to option pricing: Practitioners are aware that it is imperfect, but it gives a defined framework to risk. Weaknesses r What is the risk-free rate? The calculation assumes that we can invest and borrow at this rate. Typically we use the midmarket value from our clearing firm. But we really need to bear in mind why we are calculating the ratio when we choose the rate. A strategy that returns 6 percent is viable if we can borrow at 5 percent to gain the benefits of leverage, but is no use if our borrowing rate is 6 percent. r The Sharpe ratio is based on historical numbers. This raises a number of problems. The first is a form of the peso problem. Just because a strategy hasn’t had any losses in the past doesn’t mean that it has no risk. Many superficially enticing option strategies are of this form. It is quite easy to obtain a high Sharpe ratio (double digits) by selling far

out-of-the-money options. Most days this will make a small amount of money but eventually it will suffer a large loss. Note that while this strategy may be profitable, the objection is still valid. Any risk measure based on historical returns will show only what has happened, not what could happen. Having good statistics doesn’t mean we don’t need to carefully consider the process generating the returns. This is very important. Just looking at historical numbers does not give an indication of good future performance. In fact, past returns of hedge funds seem to have almost no predictive power for their future returns (Capocci 2007). r We stated early in Chapter 2 that measuring historical returns gives a very noisy result. We also spent considerable time looking at the sampling error in volatility estimates. We can reasonably conclude that sampling errors are a problem with the Sharpe ratio. This has been studied by Lo (2002), who showed that asymptotically the measured Sharpe ratio is normally distributed around the true Sharpe ratio with a variance of V =√ T

 (7.2)

So the standard deviation of the Sharpe ratio is the same order of magnitude as the measured result. As an example, we simulated a GBM process with an annualized drift of 0.2 and an annualized volatility of 0.3, 10,000 times. We measured the Sharpe ratio of the realized returns over 100 days. The average measured Sharpe ratio was 0.5. This was slightly lower than the theoretical value of 0.66 that was expected as the Sharpe ratio does have a measurement bias in small samples of S/ 2T (Christie 2005). But the real problem was the standard deviation of 1.61, which agrees with Lo’s result. This makes the Sharpe ratio a particularly blunt tool for distinguishing between traders or strategies. r What should we take the account size to be when calculating the returns and volatilities? If we are running a stand-alone fund, the answer is obvious: the value of assets under management. But most option traders are not operating under this arrangement. Arguments can be made for using return on utilized haircut, which is a measure of return on capital committed; or return on maximum allowed haircut, which is return on the capital the managers have allocated to the trade. If this money is not entirely committed by the trader, that reflects lack of opportunity and indicates breadth limitations of the strategy. This is a

real effect. There isn’t much point in a trader reveling in the return on committed capital if he can only find one or two trades a year. Some traders in banks may not even have access to haircut amounts. In this case they could use absolute dollar returns instead of percentage or logarithmic returns. This may be necessary when trades are backed only by credit lines rather than cash or equivalents.

Alternatives to the Sharpe Ratio The general idea is to compute the ratio of a good thing, the return, to a bad thing: the volatility. But volatility isn’t really bad. The volatility of our account caused by large profits is good. It is just losses that are bad. But Sharpe treats upside and downside volatility equally. It is actually very simple to construct some P/L paths that demonstrate this weakness of the Sharpe ratio. We can easily show two equity curves that the Sharpe ratio ranks in one order, whereas we can argue by qualitative judgment that the Sharpe ratio ranking was wrong. We present an example of this situation in Figure 7.4. The upper equity curve has a Sharpe ratio of 4.7 while the lower has a Sharpe ratio of 7.4. But clearly in some sense the upper curve is better. Another way to visualize this issue is to state that the two return distributions in Figure 7.5 have the same mean and standard deviation, but we would not expect investors to be indifferent to their risk-reward characteristics. We can change the specifics of the Sharpe ratio but keep the general idea by replacing the denominator with another measure of risk.

### FIGURE 7.5 Two Very Diﬀerent PDFs with Identical Means and Variances

A commonly used adjustment of this type is to use downside deviation instead of standard deviation. This leads to the Sortino ratio (Sortino and Price 1994): Sortino =

µ−r σd

### (7.3)

where σ d is the downside deviation, the standard deviation of all losses. Another interesting risk measure is the Calmar ratio, defined as the excess return divided by the maximum drawdown. A Calmar ratio of 1.0 is considered good. This gives us a useful rule of thumb: If you are looking for x percent return, you need to be prepared for an x percent drawdown. Calmar =

µ−r drawdown

### (7.4)

The Sterling ratio is a gains-to-losses measure very much related to the Calmar ratio. It is defined as the ratio between the excess return and the average maximum drawdown per year over the past three years minus (an arbitrary) 10 percent. Sometimes the average of the five largest drawdowns is used. The averaging procedure makes the Sterling ratio less dependent on outliers than the Calmar ratio. Each of these alternatives is even more prone to errors associated with small samples and the peso problem (as we use less data). Just as we earlier concluded that we would need to use several volatility estimators, we will need to use several performance

measures. There is no magic statistic that perfectly captures the quality of our performance. These risk measures attempt to address the fact that variance really doesn’t behave as we would like our risk to. But we now have increased sampling errors. Another way to approach the issue is to base the risk term (the denominator) on more than just the second moment of the return distribution. We could use the entire distribution. The first two moments simply do not capture all the behavior we are interested in. This is the premise behind the omega risk measure (Keating and Shadwick 2002), which is defined as b (r) =

### r

(1 − F(x))dx r

(7.5) F(x)dx

### a

where (a,b) is the interval of returns F is the cumulative distribution of returns r is the threshold return level So this is the average value of returns above the threshold, compared to the average value of returns below the threshold. The higher the omega, the higher the desirability of the strategy. Kazemi et al. (2003) show that this can also be expressed as (r) =

C(r) P(r)

### (7.6)

where C is a call on the strategy and P is a put on the strategy, each struck at the threshold and for one period (this form might make it easier for option traders to build intuition). But note that this is the value of the call under the true return distribution, not the risk-neutral distribution and certainly not the lognormal distribution. So this formulation is probably more useful conceptually rather than computationally. Omega might be theoretically nice but, as option traders are well aware, extrapolating extreme events into the future isn’t particularly wise, and the presence or absence of some extremes can significantly alter omega. (This is true for all the risk measures we have discussed, but it needs to be emphasized here that just because omega utilizes the entire distribution doesn’t mean its measurement is robust.)
Note that all of these alternatives are based on historical numbers. This is largely unavoidable, but we must always remain cognizant of this fact. Just because something horrific hasn’t happened in the past is no guarantee it won’t happen in the future. These ratios all quantify what the risk/return balance has been, and we need to apply judgment before we can conclude that they say anything sensible about the future. Conclusions

r The fact that the strengths and alternatives took about four lines to list, whereas the weaknesses took five pages, just means that the strengths are more obvious, not that they are dominated by the weaknesses. r If you understand the trading process well, the Sharpe ratio can help to quantify the results. If you don’t understand the process well enough to judge whether the Sharpe ratio’s flaws are overwhelming, no other statistical risk measure will help, either. r Scalability is probably more important than the Sharpe ratio. A Sharpe ratio of 3 is very good, but if the strategy only has a capacity of a million dollars then it can’t really form the basis of a viable business. r Traders respond to incentives. If they are rewarded for having a high Sharpe ratio they will quickly learn to game it in some way. It is important that the manager or capital provider is aware of the ways that each risk measure can be fooled. This is also a reason why all trading operations should have risk management that is separate from the trading operation. Even where no deception is intended or being deliberately attempted, traders can start to game performance measures. It is vital to have an independent overview of strategies and risk.

SETTING GOALS Now we have the necessary tools and statistics to estimate some reasonable trading goals. This could be done using analytical formulae based on the properties of the normal distribution, but it is usually far more instructive to look at the results of some simulations. Readers can run their own using the spreadsheet “tradinggoals.xls.” In Figure 7.6 we look at what happens when we simulate the results of a quarter of a year. The expected return is 100 percent on our haircut and we have a Sharpe ratio of 4. One path achieved a profit of $ 250,000 (on a haircut of $1 million) while another lost $100,000. We can see that even these (very good) numbers can give some very poor performance when viewed over such a short period. Even managers

with a good understanding of statistics can lose patience when a supposedly good trader, who was presumably given money to trade on the basis of his track record, treads water or even loses money for a quarter. Most will ask questions along the lines of, “What is going wrong?” or “Does this just not work any more?” Something could indeed be going on. The markets are always changing, and if we don’t strive to improve, we will see performance decay. But it is also possible that the trader is just unlucky and we are simply seeing the effects of variance and a small sample size. In this case, much angst could be saved by setting realistic goals at the start of the year. Here the trader and his manager and capital providers could come up with something like the following:

r After one quarter we will reevaluate the operation and check that nothing material has changed that could adversely affect the trade. For example, a market making operation could obviously be impacted by the introduction of penny quotes in options. This sort of structural change cannot be ignored. r Profits of more than $400,000 would indicate that everything is working well and we can be reasonably confident that the trader is as good as we expected. We might even consider allocating more capital to this particular trade. r Profits of between $0 and $200,000 should leave us cautiously optimistic. We would leave capital allocation at the initial level. r Losses of more than $250,000 will be cause to stop trading and reevaluate the operation. We now have definite benchmarks. These can always be reevaluated, but it is vital to have established them before trading starts. Having them

established prior to trading makes it harder to fall victim to overmanagement, either by you or by your capital providers. Adjusting trade size drastically based on recent results is suboptimal. Pick an account size and a sizing scheme and stick to it. There will always come a time when someone asks if your last period of results indicates that something material has changed. Unless it is obvious that something has actually changed, it is very dangerous to speculate about this. Obviously, every trade result can be ascribed to some effect or other. We can attach some narrative to every result. But our testing and previous trading results should be considered far stronger evidence than the immediate past. How many previous times have you had similar results? Did they show up in back-testing? I recently spoke to a trader who had generated 80 percent winning days (he was scalping commodity future spreads, a very short gamma profile trade). He was asked by management if he should trade smaller after two consecutive losing days. Given that 20 percent of his days were losers, two losing days in a row was not uncommon. His manager wasn’t suggesting trading smaller purely because his account was smaller as a result of his losses, as you would if you were following a Kelly sizing methodology. He was suggesting arbitrarily dropping size by 50 percent. Trading smaller here would only indicate that his manager wasn’t really comfortable with the trade at all. This can happen. It is fair that people can change their mind, and refusing to do so in cases where the new evidence is compelling is very worrisome. But arbitrarily trading smaller is almost never a good idea. If you still like the basic premise of the trade, if the results are consistent with past results, if the market isn’t obviously and dramatically different, and if the capital provider’s overall portfolio hasn’t dramatically changed, then you should just keep going. Otherwise this discretionary overriding of the trade sizing will be (by a considerable amount) the largest single determining factor in a strategy’s profitability. Is it really a good idea to mix a carefully tested methodology that may generate hundreds or thousands of trades each year with three or four externally generated override decisions? Another reason against trading smaller in this way is that while it reduces the results of the trading, it also proportionally increases the drag of many fixed costs. This can make it impossible to succeed at all. Remember that you should only be doing trades you like. If you aren’t confident enough in the basic idea, don’t trade it at all.

PERSISTENCE OF PERFORMANCE Are there any complementary methods we could use to distinguish the skill in our performance from luck? By skill we mean repeatable and active

management. The repeatable qualification is important. Golf would certainly be regarded as a skillful activity, but hitting one fairway in every hundred drives would not be considered a good example of skill. We require a certain amount of consistency in our results. In fact, when it comes to trading, consistency is far better than return. We have said this several times already. A consistent result can be more safely leveraged. If the cumulative profits are smooth enough we can use leverage to get any return we like. While performance measurement over a given period (by whatever measure we choose) gives a static view of performance, its persistence is more revealing. We are really looking for persistent, good performance. Sadly, there is no simple way to achieve consistency other than by trying to do our best on each trade. But we can at least hope to measure consistency. This might be helpful when monitoring our own progress or when deciding to get involved with other traders (or any actively managed account). Simply comparing performance in successive time periods is unlikely to yield any statistically significant results, although sometimes a fundamental change in the market will make it obvious that two periods cannot be sensibly compared. For example, it is obvious that the performance of a market maker will change when the tick size in his product is reduced from nickels to pennies. At this point it is also worth emphasizing that two aspects of performance persistence exist. The first is relative persistence. That refers to persistence of a ranking between winners and losers. The second is absolute persistence. This refers to persistence of a trader or strategy without considering any others. These are two different things and one does not necessarily imply the other.

Relative Persistence This is the easiest to quantify. It is of practically no use to individual traders but it can be very useful to a manager who has to allocate capital and risk amongst a number of traders. It can be simply (and nonparametrically) estimated by applying the cross product ratio (CPR) test. Here we split the time period in two and look at the performances of each trader in each period. Those who perform above the median (based on whatever criterion we might chose) are designated good, G, and those who fall below the median are bad, B. So, for example, a trader who performed well in the first subperiod but poorly in the second would be labeled GB. The CPR ratio is defined as CPR =

GC · BB GC · BG

### (7.7)

### TABLE 7.2

G B

Trader Performance in the Two Subperiods G

### B

If there is no persistence, each designation will contain 25 percent of the traders and the ratio will be equal to 1. A score greater than 1 indicates persistence. The significance of the ratio is tested by calculating the z statistic, where z= 

ln (CPR) + + + GC BB G B BG

### (7.8)

Consider the example where we can allocate between 40 different opportunities (traders, strategies, or funds). We split them up into the four categories and get results in Table 7.2. Here the CPR is given by (12 × 9)/(11 × 8) = 1.23. This is greater than 1, but the sample size is small and it is quite possible that the true population ratio is 1. The z score from equation (7.8) is 0.32. To be significant at the 5 percent level we require a score of over 1.96. So this isn’t even close to being significant. There are other tests for relative persistence (for example chi-square, Spearman correlation, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but we won’t look at these because this type of persistence isn’t really an overwhelming concern for most traders. What they really want to see is absolute persistence.

Absolute Persistence We can calculate a measure of pure persistence in a trader’s returns by calculating the Hurst exponent. A Hurst exponent greater than 0.5 indicates persistence. An exponent less than 0.5 is indicative of antipersistence or mean reversion. The Hurst exponent applies to data sets that are statistically self-similar. This means that the statistical properties for the data set are constant (this is an assumption that we make in most of these analyses). The Hurst exponent is intimately related to the fractal dimension of a data set and chaos theory, which is well beyond the scope of this book. The interested reader should refer to Peters 1996 and the references therein. First we need to understand rescaled range analysis (often called R/S analysis). We know that when we flip an unbiased coin, the expected

difference between the number of heads and tails in N attempts grows as N 0.5 . This is a characteristic of Brownian motions. In general, R ≈ cN h

### (7.9)

where R is the range c is a constant h is the scaling exponent; h = 0.5 in the coin-tossing example. Hurst (1951) generalized this concept from the special case where h = 0.5. We start with a time series, xt , and construct the series of deviations Dt,N =

t 

### (xk − M N )

### (7.10)

### k=1

where Dt,N is the cumulative deviation over N periods M N is the average of xt over N periods The range is then defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value calculated in equation (7.10). R = max(Dt,N ) − min(Dt,N )

### (7.11)

We now normalize the range by dividing by the standard deviation of the original observations. This is the rescaled range, R/S. The Hurst exponent, h, is defined by R/S = (aN)h

### (7.12)

Taking logarithms gives us an equation that can easily be estimated by linear regression. ln(R/S) = h ln(N) + ln(a)

### (7.13)

This requires a fairly large amount of data to estimate accurately. Hurst also gave a simple approximation, which estimates h from a single value. h=

ln(R/S)   N ln

### (7.14)
This assumes that the constant a in equation (7.13) is equal to 0.5. This approximation tends to overstate h when it is greater than 0.7 and understate h when it is less than 0.4. However, for short data series where regression results will be unreliable, it gives a reasonable estimate. When applying rescaled range analysis to trading results, the time series under consideration should be the logarithmic return series. Without doubt, the toughest situation to evaluate and handle is where a long-term winning trade starts to degrade in performance. Can we just put this down to luck? That could be possible, but we need to be as careful here, when separating randomness from signal, as we were when we were evaluating successful trades. After a certain number of trades, only a few possibilities remain:

r The source of edge has disappeared. Sometimes this can be obvious, such as when the tick size in QQQQ options was reduced from a nickel to a penny. This was clearly an issue market makers needed to adapt to. But sometimes the cause of the degradation is more subtle. I am good friends with a very successful baseball gambler who in 2003 had a return of over 400 percent with a Sharpe ratio of 4. The bets were based on extensive sabermetric analysis and computer simulations. By 2007 his return had dwindled to nothing. He had learned more about baseball, but the market had learned faster (he now trades equity options). r Their ability to execute the trade has declined. This could be due to changing technology (which could probably go into the preceding category if technological execution was actually the original source of edge) or to the effects of increasing age or lack of desire. r The counterparties of their trades have changed. There is a very big difference to taking the other side of retail flow and trading with other professionals. Once you have identified a change in performance, you need to compare your current methodology to your behavior when you were winning. What has changed? Sometimes you will find that you are now taking shortcuts due to boredom or overfamiliarity. If you can’t find any differences, get a second opinion. Changes, in ourselves or in the markets, can occur so gradually that we are unaware of them. Sometimes it pays to ask, “If I was starting today, would I choose this product to trade? Why?” (Flexibility when it comes to choosing products is a great advantage. This option is generally not available to institutional traders, but even if the question is hypothetical, it can be a useful exercise to identify possible changes that need to be adapted to). A good rule to remember is that it is making money that counts, not trading the most complex or glamorous products. This isn’t like
professional sports. Hitting 0.400 in the minors isn’t the same as doing it in the major leagues, but in trading, a million dollars is a million dollars. We are all professionals. There are no minor leagues.

SUMMARY Record keeping isn’t very exciting or glamorous, but it is exceptionally important. It is impossible to improve if you don’t know exactly how good you are and what areas need most improvement. Setting up a results-tracking and performance-measurement methodology is probably the single best thing that a trader could do to improve.

r Keep track of the daily results of all trades. r All trades should have preestablished goals so that terms like success and failure are defined in advance.

r All instances where a trading signal is overridden, either by a trader or by a manager, should be noted so that we know how successful such calls are. r All risk measures have weaknesses. As with our use of different volatility estimators, learn to use a variety of measures and become comfortable with the different pictures they provide. r Remain aware that even a good strategy can go through bad periods. Don’t give up on the basis of a poor performance over a small sample size unless something has definitely changed in the market. r Consistency of performance is more important than the actual level of performance.
