# Chapter 9: Trade Sizing & The Kelly Criterion with Stops

CHAPTER 9 Trade Sizing It certainly is not true that good risk management can turn a strategy with no positive expectation into a winner. Risk management can change the return distribution of a strategy with dynamic trade sizing and the use of stops and profit targets, but unless there is real edge somewhere the idea will eventually lose money. However, this doesn't make risk control irrelevant. Bad risk management can turn a potentially profitable idea into a loser. And, because risk management is the only part of the trading process that is completely under the control of the trader, there is no excuse for not doing it as well as possible. In this chapter, I restate why the Kelly criterion should form the basis of a trade-sizing scheme and look at two extensions that are particularly important when trading options: non-normal trade returns and uncertainty about the return distribution.

The Kelly Criterion It is well-known that investing according to the Kelly criterion (Kelly, 1956) will theoretically outperform any other sizing strategy. No other sizing scheme will produce greater long-term growth. This doesn't mean that everyone tries or even wants to invest like this. There are three kinds of reasons for this: The Kelly criterion maximizes the long-term growth rate of the bankroll. But it is completely legitimate to have other goals. For example, many traders are more interested in maximizing the probability of hitting a goal in a given time (see Browne, 1999, 2000a, 2000b). No one has a utility function that is as simple as the log function that matches the Kelly scheme. This is fair. Some traders try to deny the math. They don't like the volatile return stream and decide that this is a flaw of the system. It isn't. Whether or not you like what Kelly says, it is a mathematical fact. It's objectively true. It is common for people to conflate their dislike of a situation with its truth.

Examples of this are evolution, climate change, and the Kelly criterion. Some people create strawman arguments about the mathematics, claiming that Kelly only applies to simplified, unrealistic situations. This isn't true at all. The mathematics of maximizing growth rate are quite general. A derivation of the Kelly criterion for both discrete and continuous outcomes is given in Sinclair (2013), together with a discussion of the distribution of results we can expect when investing this way. The important results can be summarized as follows.

Good Kelly maximizes growth rate. The expected time to reach any goal is minimized. It is impossible to go bankrupt. The strategy depends only on the current bankroll, not the specific trade results that led to it. It is essentially unbeatable.

Bad The best bets can be uncomfortably large. Portfolio volatility and drawdowns are large. Because of compounding, it is reasonably common to find that an equal number of wins and losses leaves you with a net loss. Here I want to look at two slight extensions that are very important to traders, particularly option traders. What happens when outcomes are highly non-normal? And what happens when we are uncertain of outcomes and probabilities? These are two aspects of the same general problem. Trading success is largely dependent on how robust our ideas are. At best our knowledge is uncertain. Probably our knowledge is incomplete and only partially correct. In particular, we will be ignorant of the true probabilities of rare events. These will be the events that drive



non-normality, and, because they appear only rarely, they will be those that we are most uncertain of. To introduce the ideas, we first look at the fairly impractical case of discrete trade results.

Non-normal Discrete Outcomes Imagine we have a discrete set of outcomes Wi, each with probability pi. We bet a fraction, f, of our bankroll on each opportunity. So, the gain factor per trade is (9.1) Alternatively, the exponential growth per unit bet is (9.2) To find the value of f that maximizes the exponential growth rate, we differentiate with respect to f and set the derivative to zero. If i is greater than 2, this is unwieldly or impossible and we need to use numerical methods. A numerical solution of a simple example is illustrative.

Case One p1 = 0.55 p2 = 0.45 W1 = 1 W2 = −1 (55% chance of winning a dollar and 45% chance of losing a dollar) This implies fmax = 0.1. The dependence of the exponential growth rate on f is shown in Figure 9.1.

Reconsidered Case p1 = 0.55 p2 = 0.43 p3 = 0.02 W1 = 1 W2 = −1 W3 = −3 Here the probability, p3, of the extreme event is low enough that we could easily misestimate it from historical data. But the implications of including this small probability are far from negligible. The growth rate is illustrated in Figure 9.2. In this case fmax is 0.5, half of that in the two-outcome case. And growth rate becomes negative for f > 0.1. An event with only a 2% chance of occurrence could easily be missed when we estimate parameters, and if we erroneously think p3 = 0, we will bet at a size that gives a negative growth rate. This phenomenon is qualitatively similar when returns are continuous. Because this is the more relevant situation for trading,

that is what we will assume when deriving methods to live with these issues.

Non-normal Continuous Outcomes We are interested in the case where the outcome of a trade is known to have a certain continuous distribution. We bet a fraction, f, of our wealth at the start of each period so that (9.3) where Bn is the random variable giving the result of the nth trade and it has the payoff g(Xn). After a sequence of n trades our bankroll will be (9.4)

Now we take logarithms: (9.5)



so (9.6)

### (9.7)

where Φ(x) is the distribution function that describes the results of the trades. If we maximize over the bankroll fraction, f, we find that the optimal value is the one that satisfies (9.8)

Applying a Taylor expansion to this equation gives (9.9)

So, if f is small, we can truncate the series after the first term to get (9.16) And further, if μ is small, we can further approximate by (9.17) This is the usual expression for the Kelly ratio of a trade with a continuum of outcomes, but it is only an approximation and if we are in a situation where skewness is important, a better approximation can be obtained if we keep the third term, so that equation 9.13 becomes (9.18) We can solve this equation to get (9.19)

Equation 9.19 only has real solutions if (9.20)



(which is a limitation of our sloppy use of asymptotics). Further, it isn't immediately obvious which root is the correct one. Also, the case where skewness is zero leads to a singularity. We can address these issues by taking the limit as skewness approaches zero. To do this note that (9.21)

(if b is small relative to a). So if (9.22) we can write (9.23)

And so the negative root of equation 9.19 is approximately (9.24)

which simplifies to (9.25)

So, in order for the limiting case to agree with the Kelly fraction when trades are normally distributed (equations 9.16 and 9.17), we need to take the negative root. From a practitioner's perspective, the important thing is to note that negative skewness decreases the optimal investment fraction

and positive skewness increases the optimal investment fraction. This effect is shown in Figure 9.3. Figure 9.4 shows the approximation of equation 9.25.

FIGURE 9.4 The approximate investment fraction as a function of skewness (return is 0.015, volatility is 0.5).

### Uncertain Parameters



The value of the optimal sizing fraction will generally need to be estimated from empirical data. Because empirical data will always have sampling errors and uncertainty, the estimate of the sizing parameter will also have a degree of uncertainty attached to it. This is well-known by professional gamblers. And to mitigate the risk of over-betting, bettors following a Kelly scheme often modify the Kelly criterion by investing only a fraction of the optimal amount. These schemes are known as “fractional Kelly” sizing. By doing this, traders accept that they will be reducing growth but will also more drastically reduce variance. However, simply scaling the investment fraction doesn't protect against a bigger problem: the case in which the investment fraction is estimated to be positive, but the true value is negative. In this case, investing any positive fraction of the bankroll will be over-betting. In order to estimate the chances of this happening we need the variance of the estimated Kelly criterion ratio (Sinclair, 2014). fmax (approximated in equation 9.17) is a statistical estimator and has an associated probability distribution. First consider the case of normal trade results. Here the central limit theorem says that the estimators of the mean, , and variance, asymptotically have the following normal distributions, where and are the population mean and variances respectively. (9.26) (9.27) Alternatively, the estimation errors of mean,

### and variance,

can be approximated by (9.28)



(9.29) denoted by f(μ,σ2), the Kelly ratio of equation 9.17. So the estimator is just . The estimation errors in the mean and variance will lead to estimation errors in f. If we define theta to be the column vector of the normal distribution's parameters, this has an estimate of For IID returns,

now a function that estimates the Kelly ratio, we next apply the delta method (see, for example, Oehlert, 1992). This states that the variance of a function

is (9.30)

### (9.31)

and (9.32)

so, evaluating equation 9.30 gives the asymptotic variance of our estimate of the Kelly ratio as



### (9.33)

If the trade returns are not normally distributed, we need to make use of the result (Zhang, 2007) that (9.34) where is the third central moment of the population distribution. Now equation 9.30 gives (9.35)

### (9.36)

It isn't possible to find the variance of the sizing fraction given by equation 9.19, because the variance of the skewness would need to be evaluated for the particular distribution the results were drawn from. The best we can do in general is to measure the empirical skewness, calculate the sizing ratio using equation 9.19, then estimate the variance around that value by using equation 9.36. We now use an example of real trade results to show the importance of including estimation error in trade sizing. The trade results are from a proprietary short volatility strategy. It is somewhat typical of many such strategies in that it has a positive expected value but a large negative kurtosis. The summary statistics for these trade results are given in Table 9.1 and the distribution of results is shown in Figure 9.5. We can rearrange (and slightly modify) equation 9.36 to give an explicit expression for the estimated standard deviation of the Kelly ratio.

### Skewness

FIGURE 9.5 The distribution of the option trade results. Because of the central limit theorem, we know that the distribution of f is normal so we can calculate the probability that f is actually below any critical value f*.



### (9.38)

where Z is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution with mean of f and a standard deviation calculated from equation 9.38. Equation 9.17 gives the Kelly ratio as 0.046, but equation 9.37 tells us that the standard deviation of this point estimate is 0.031, so our point estimate is only 1.4 standard deviations above zero. There is an 7% chance that the true Kelly ratio of the population is less than zero. Having an expression for the sampling distribution also enables us to estimate the chance that we are over-betting so much that our growth rate is negative. This case corresponds to the true value of f being roughly less than half the estimated value. Equation 9.38 tells us this is 25%.

Corresponding Benchmark 0.0092 0.0161 0.0215

Kelly Scale Factor 0.2054 0.3574 0.4782

This leads us to a complimentary way to use the information. We can use equation 9.38 to solve for a benchmark given that we want

a certain chance of over-betting. For example, we have just seen that using a benchmark of half the measured Kelly fraction (i.e., betting at “half-Kelly”) still implies a 25% chance that we will be over-betting. Table 9.2 shows the probabilities of over-betting for various fractional Kelly schemes. So, in order to introduce a margin of safety we would need to scale the measured Kelly ratio by a considerable amount. This is in line with the practice of professional gamblers. Much of this need for scaling is due to the presence of negative skewness. If the returns were normally distributed, the scaling could be reduced. This is shown in Table 9.3.

Kelly and Drawdown Control Even after calculating and allowing for our measurement uncertainty, it is likely that investors will find that investing the full Kelly fraction leads to results that are unpalatably volatile. And the more edge there is, the higher the Kelly ratio will be and so the higher the volatility will be. Good trades are the most volatile. The standard way to mitigate drawdowns is to trade using a fraction of the Kelly ratio. In this case, both growth rate and volatility will drop. If we trade at a fraction, f, of the Kelly ratio, the growth rate is (9.39)

This is maximized for f = 1 and drops as the investment fraction is reduced from this (Figure 9.6). Measures of risk and drawdown also decrease as the investment fraction drops. The ratio of growth rate to drawdown is shown in Figure 9.7 for the case where μ = 0.05 and σ = 0.3.

FIGURE 9.7 The growth rate to drawdown ratio as a function of the scaling factor.



FIGURE 9.8 The probability of reaching 200% before being stopped out at 0% when trading at fractions of the Kelly ratio. So, if drawdown is the primary risk factor, you should be very cautious indeed. Another way to quantify the effect of changing the investment ratio is by looking at the chance of hitting a lower barrier (possibly the stop level) before reaching a target. If the stop percentage level is A, and the target is B, the probability is given by (9.40)

(Interestingly, neither the return nor volatility of the return stream is relevant. A “good” trade means the level will be hit earlier but doesn't change the relative probability.) The dependence of the probability on the scaling fraction, f, is shown in Figure 9.8 for the case A = 50%, B = 200%. A very conservative trading size will raise the probability of a good outcome because the volatility associated with Kelly betting is dampened to the point that hitting a stop is unlikely. However, a very small scaling factor also means that the expected time to hit the goal increases. The expected exit time is given by



### (9.41)

Expected exit time as a function of f, for the case A = 50% and B = 200%, and μ = 0.05 and σ = 0.3. is shown in Figure 9.9.

FIGURE 9.9 The expected time to reach 200% before being stopped out at 50% when trading at fractions of the Kelly ratio for the case where μ = 0.05 and σ = 0.3. (Note that the average exit time is monotonically decreasing in f, even decreasing when expected growth rate is negative. At this point, you will probably get stopped out, but you also might just get lucky.) In terms of risk mitigation, it is easy to make a case for trading at only a fraction of Kelly. However, doing this will also affect the good points of the method. Further, due to sampling issues when we estimate the parameters, we may be betting in a negative expectation game. We can mitigate these issues by combining the Kelly concept with a stop.

The Effect of Stops To many traders, the use of stops is seen as an essential part of risk control and money management. And usually they take the utility of stops to be self-evident. “How can you go broke if you limit your losses?” “Cut your losses and let your profits run.”

“Losers add to losers.” But the effect of stop use is quite complex. In this section I will explain where stops help, where they don't, their effect on profitability, and, if you are using them, where to set them. First, we examine what the use of stops does to the distribution of our trading results. A hypothetical trade result example is shown in Figure 9.10. The trade results are normally distributed with a mean return of 10% and a standard deviation of 15%.

FIGURE 9.10 The return distribution of our trading strategy. However, we can also see that a significant number of trades were losers (here nearly 11% of trades will lose more than 15%). A natural thought would be to introduce a stop loss to somehow “cut off” the left-hand side of the distribution. It is tempting to think that use of a stop simply truncates the downside of the distribution by capping losses at a certain level. Redrawing the distribution to reflect this intuition situation gives us Figure 9.11, where a stop has been introduced at the 15% down level, so all loses are capped at 15%. But a little thought will be enough to see that this distribution isn't possible. The trades that get stopped out don't just disappear. Their results still have to be accounted for (mathematically, the integral of the probability density function must still be 1). So we next surmise that these trades cluster around the level of the stop. But this still misses an important point.



FIGURE 9.11 The hoped-for distribution when a stop has been added. Many trades that at the end of the period will be small winners and will have been stopped out beforehand. Note that the large winners will still remain because these largely consist of trades that started as winners and never looked back, but the presence of a stop will drastically reduce the number of small winners. This is the hidden cost of using a stop. To see the exact effect, I simulated 1,000 GBM paths that represented checking the performance of the trade once a day for a year. Again, the expected final return was 10%, the standard deviation was 15%, and a stop was placed to cap losses at 15%. Results are shown in Figure 9.12. There are several things to note here. First, the average return is negatively affected by using stops. The “unstopped” investment has a mean return of 10% (as we planned for the simulation), but when we add a stop this drops to 9.6%, and the median is now 8.6%. This is the mathematical inevitability of assuming that the (unstopped) results follow the normal distribution. By adding a stop, we eliminate the big losers (in this case of greater than 15%) but we also eliminate trades that would have later recovered above the stop level. And because the normal distribution has more density around the mean than it does in the wings, there are more of these marginal trades than there are big losers.



This analysis has been for a fixed stop, set at a given distance from our entry price. The other type of stop is the trailing stop, which is set so it stays a certain distance from the highest amount the investment has made. A trailing stop is a very comforting strategy. It protects us from the painful experience of seeing our winners turn into losers.

FIGURE 9.12 The true distribution when a stop has been added.

FIGURE 9.13 The return distribution of the simulated trade when using a trailing stop. However, the trailing stop costs even more than the fixed stop. This is because some positions that would be large winners don't

get the chance to fully realize their potential. When using fixed stops, some investments benefit by getting away from the stop and having the chance to develop. Trailing stops are always in play. Adapting our previous simulation confirms this. The trailing stop is always 15% below the high of the trade. The addition of a trailing stop lowers the mean return of the trade to only 9.4%, and the median is 8.0%. This is lower than the unstopped return and also lower than when employing a fixed stop. Figure 9.13 shows the distribution when we employ a trailing stop. The distribution in this case is now totally different from that of the unstopped investment. Stops don't just stop losses. They drastically change the shape of the return distribution and can lower the average return. Adding stops won't transform a losing strategy into a winning strategy. The only reason that we would add a stop is that we prefer the shape of the stopped distribution, that is, we prefer to trade lots of small losses and fewer small wins for some large losses. Although this is true, the real world is far more complex. Returns are not normally distributed and the results will change over time. Also, there is no reason a trader need only be interested in maximizing returns. Safety and risk control are important for both financial and psychological reasons. Obviously, many traders like using stops. Indeed, some insist that stops are absolutely essential and that their appropriate use is a good predictor of overall, long-term success. Given that most tests show that stops cost money, what is it that these traders are thinking? Let's take a quick look at some of the common arguments given for using stops: Stops limit losses. For any given trade this is trivially true. Ignoring slippage and trading costs, we can't lose more than a certain predefined amount on any investment when we use a stop. But, as we have seen in our simple simulation, in aggregate this is an illusion. Using stops will lower returns in the long term so this reason at best needs more justification and is probably just incorrect. Stops are a form of discipline. It is true that if you always use stops, then you have displayed discipline. But discipline needs to be about applying a sensible methodology

consistently, not just doing something consistently. If your idea has negative return, executing it diligently will result in greater losses than doing it haphazardly. Using stops means all trades risk the same amount. Some traders have the idea that it is important to risk a certain set amount on each investment (1% or 2% is often the amount given). This is generally false. Different trades, even within the same strategy, will have different projected risks and returns. It is best to take this into account when trade sizing. Not doing so will lead to lower total returns and unnecessary risk. Further, trade sizing and risk control are a different issue from setting a loss for each single position. A stop is a predefined exit. The trade will be stopped out when we don't want to be in the position anymore. It should be obvious that exiting a position when we don't want to be in it is an excellent idea. If we use stops to formalize this, then they are perfectly sensible. But we need to think more about what this means. If we are exiting a position purely because the price has moved by a given amount, then we are assuming the trade has positive autocorrelation: the move that has already happened is predictive of a future move. Price-based stops are a trend-following system. So they make a good deal of sense if we are explicitly betting on momentum. Conversely, they don't make a lot of sense if we are trading something that we expect to revert. In this case we will be exiting trades at points where we see potential for future profit. We should never exit a position when a trader with the same strategy and no position would want to enter. Rephrased, the reason we should get out of a position that has moved against us is if, and only if, we expect the move to continue. The loss has already been incurred; we need to think about our current risk, not the sunk cost of the incurred loss. And if we are only basing the stop on the price action, we are saying price direction alone determines future price direction, that is, we are trend following. A position should be exited when we are wrong. Sometimes this will coincide with losing money. In this case a stop is harmless. But sometimes losing money corresponds to situations for which we have more edge. Here a stop is



actively damaging and contrary to the idea behind the strategy.

Stop Placement Once we have decided we want to use a stop, we still need to choose where to put it. There are two aspects to this: game theory and statistics. The role of game theory is often emphasized although it is the less important consideration. The idea is to avoid placing stops in “obvious” price levels such as around the highs or lows of the previous session, key technical levels, or round numbers. Other traders could take advantage of this predictability. For example, imagine the market was quoted at 98 bid and 99 offered and a trader knew there were likely to be buy stops set at 100. He could get long at 99, print a trade at 100, and set off the stops. This would drive the price higher, giving him an instant profit. This sort of tactic was common on trading floors, but the higher liquidity and different sociological structure of electronic markets means the idea is less relevant than it once was. It probably doesn't hurt to avoid placing orders at these levels, but it almost certainly doesn't matter much. The more important consideration is choosing a stop price that correctly balances risk and costs. If a stop is too far away, it isn't doing much to reduce risk and if it is too close, it will get hit too often, increasing transaction costs and not giving trades enough of a chance to become winners. There have been many attempts to establish a theoretical basis for stop placement. Unfortunately, the results are highly dependent on both the assumed price process and the trader's utility function. For example, a risk-neutral trader who is long an instrument with a positive drift will never use a stop. We can never be completely sure about either the price process or parameters and our utility function is likely to be a function of many things other than just wealth. So, these theories aren't helpful. There have also been a number of empirical tests of the efficacy of stops. The problem is that these are tests of the interplay between a stop and a particular strategy. They can possibly help as guides,



but they will never apply particularly well to a different strategy or set of instruments. Some such studies are those by Lei and Li (2009), Clare et al. (2013), and Han et al. (2016). Instead we need to use a completely empirical method for each strategy we are considering. Here, the only theoretical assumption is the usual one that the past return distribution is predictive of the future. It is never a great idea to base a trading decision only on data analysis but at this point I don't think that there is a better way to choose stop parameters than just testing various ideas.

Incorporating Stops into the Kelly Criterion Conceptually, we split the trading account into two parts: a risky part that we trade according to the Kelly criterion and the riskless part that we hold in cash. If we never transfer profits from the risky part to the safe part, we are using a fixed stop. For example, we split our $100 account into $80 cash and an active trading subaccount of $20. We will never be able to lose more than $20 (in theory we can't even lose all of that because we will be trading proportionally) but we can suffer larger peak-to-trough drawdowns if we first make money and then lose those profits as well as the original $20. This idea has been studied by Grossman and Zhou (1993), Cvitanic and Karatzas (1995), and Browne (2000b). Consider trading our $100 in two situations with identical growth rates. Our trading strategy has a mean return of 5% and a volatility of 30%. In one case we trade at one-quarter of the Kelly ratio, which according to equation 9.39 gives a growth rate of 0.0061. So, after one year the expected account value is $100.61, and the volatility is 0.75, or $7,546. The complete distribution of results is shown in Figure 9.14.



FIGURE 9.14 The distribution of the final account after 10,000 simulations of a GBM where μ = 0.05 and σ = 0.3 when using a quarter of the Kelly ratio. Full Kelly gives a growth rate of 0.139. To achieve the same expected account value using a smaller subaccount, Wr, which trades at full Kelly, we solve the equation (9.42) which gives Wr = $43.7. Initial volatility is 0.3 or $13. So, the subaccount method gives the same growth rate but with a higher dollar volatility. This doesn't seem promising. But things are better when we consider the entire distribution. We have given ourselves some downside protection while still retaining the possibility of the extreme growth that Kelly can give. This is shown in Figure 9.15. Another method is to adjust the amount in our safe subaccount to stay a constant percentage below the peak. We will be using a trailing stop on the account value. This time we use a trailing stop level of 43%. The distribution of results from using this method are shown in Figure 9.16. From the figures the higher volatility of the subaccount method is largely due to the positive upside. Summary statistics are shown in Table 9.4. Using a percentage-based trailing stop retains many good features of the aggressiveness of the Kelly criterion. It does better both on

average and in the extreme cases. The great results are those that start well and continue well, never being affected by the stop. And when the stop does come into play, the trailing stop idea protects capital nearly as well as the other two, more conservative, methods. Trading according to full Kelly on a percentage-based subaccount seems to be the best idea no matter what criteria are considered.

Conclusion The Kelly criterion is only optimal in the sense that it maximizes growth. There are many other things a trader could be interested in maximizing. However, using a modified Kelly scheme that explicitly includes higher-order moments in the return stream, sampling errors and drawdown control is a consistent, sensible method that is vastly preferable to either an ad-hoc strategy or one that is based on mistaken ideas.

Summary Adjust the Kelly ratio to account for skew. Trade negatively (positively) skewed strategies and instruments smaller (larger) than suggested by the standard Kelly criterion approximation. Quantify the uncertainty in the estimate of the Kelly ratio. Scale the raw ratio to give a prespecified chance of it being non-negative. Split the trading account into an untraded percentage and a traded percentage. Apply full Kelly to the risky part of the



portfolio.
