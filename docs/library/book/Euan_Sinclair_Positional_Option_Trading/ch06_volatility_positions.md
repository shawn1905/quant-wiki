CHAPTER 6 Volatility Positions One of the things that make options great is that there are many ways to express an opinion. But this is also one of the things that make options tricky. Just because there are many ways to express an opinion doesn't mean they will all be equally good. The differences are not trivial. Some will be a lot worse than others. In this section we will compare some option positions that are primarily used to express views on volatility. We will look at the possible distribution of returns by using both GBM returns and historical data. We will also look at the effects of the underlying having a drift. This will generally be done from the perspective of a volatility seller, but the case of long volatility is a trivial extension. All of the simulations will assume that we initiate the position and then leave it alone until expiration. In reality, we will usually have opportunities to trade out of the position before then. But it is important to understand the terminal distribution of the P/L for several reasons: Even an adjusted (or hedged) position is instantaneously subject to the same issues as one that won't be adjusted in the future. Very short-dated options (depending on the market liquidity this could be weekly, daily, or hourly) can't meaningfully be adjusted. The actual adjustment procedure will be different for different traders so will be impossible to simulate.

Aside: Adjustment and Position “Repair” “Repair” is a dangerous misnomer. First, in any other situation to repair something is to return it to its previous condition. But in the trading world it is usually taken to mean turning a losing trade into a winning trade. This is a falsely reassuring idea, but it can't be done. The loss is already in your account. That money is gone. Forget about the original trade and ask yourself, “Given what I

now know, what position do I want?” Then put that position on. This is completely independent of the original trade. This should also be done when examining winning positions. Their profits are also in the past. Do you like the position now? If not, do something else. You should adjust a position when it no longer matches your forecast or opinion. This is true whether it has previously made money or lost money.

Straddles and Strangles The two most basic ways to short volatility are to sell either a straddle or a strangle. It is easy to work out the expected profit of an option position. It is just the position value at the volatility we sold at, minus the position value evaluated at the realized volatility. Or in terms of vega: (6.1) But this doesn't tell the whole story. Unhedged option positions are not exposed to path dependency in the underlying, but their profitability is still tied to the returns of the underlying. Returns are not relevant when pricing options, but the final option return is enormously dependent on returns. And even a truly driftless process will have periods when it appears to trend. Further, when selling options our upside is capped by the collected premium, but our downside is infinite. This means that all short option positions will have significant negative skew in their P/L. Because of all this I evaluated the strategies by running simulations. I sold a 1-year ATM straddle on a $100 stock at 30% implied volatility and then simulated 10,000 paths of the stock where the realized volatility was also 30%. The drift and interest rates were both zero. There are two ways to quantify these results. We could either track returns on the margin required (for the short straddle, strategybased margin would be $2,000) or in terms of dollars. Most professional option traders think in terms of dollars so that is what we will do, but the overall conclusions would be very similar if we considered returns.



FIGURE 6.1 The profit distribution of the short straddle. The distribution of profits (in dollars) is shown in Figure 6.1. The dollar value of the straddle was $2,385 (assuming the convention of the options being on 100 shares). So, the maximum profit is $2,385. As the implied and subsequent realized volatilities were the same, the average profit should have been zero. The simulation confirms both of these figures. Statistics are summarized in Table 6.1. (The minimum is included as an indicative number and should not be relied on as the sampling error is huge for extrema. The 10th percentile is a better measure of downside risk.) Next we run the same simulation for a short 70/130 strangle (corresponding to shorting the 9-delta put and the 23-delta call). To get the same vega exposure as we had with the short straddle, we need to sell 1.68 strangles. This position has an initial value of $841. The distribution of profits (in dollars) is shown in Figure 6.2. TABLE 6.1 Summary Statistics for the Returns of a Fairly Priced Short Straddle Average Standard deviation Skewness Excess kurtosis

FIGURE 6.2 The profits of the short strangle. The dollar value of the position was $841. So, the maximum profit is $841. Again, the average return should have been zero. As before, the simulation confirms both of these figures. But the results are also much more negatively skewed than for the straddle. And even if you don't look at the numbers, a quick glance at the histograms tells us a lot. The strangle hits its maximum profit about 60% of the time, but, because the total premium we took in is lower than with the straddle, the losses can be much greater. Statistics are summarized in Table 6.2. Because there are many situations in which selling volatility has a positive expected value, when we enter short volatility positions, we should focus on controlling our risk. If we can keep plugging along, the profits should eventually take care of themselves. So instead of just comparing the straddle and strangle in the case where we had no edge, we now look at the results where we are completely wrong. Specifically, realized volatility was 70%. The straddle returns for this scenario are shown in Figure 6.3, and statistics are summarized in Table 6.3.

FIGURE 6.3 The returns of the short straddle when our forecast was poor. Not a good set of results. But we were very wrong in our volatility forecast, so we can't really expect great results. But now look at the returns of the strangle in Figure 6.4 and Table 6.4. Again, we can see that the extreme results (minimum and 10th percentile) were worse than the corresponding straddle returns. However, generally speaking, the poor volatility forecast had similar effects on both the straddle and strangle results.

The returns of the two option structures in this scenario are summarized in Tables 6.5 and 6.6. Again, the strangle is profitable more often than the straddle, but it can go more badly wrong. The difference between the average profits is largely due to the initial delta of the positions. The straddle had a delta of −12, and the strangle delta was −15. When scaled by the size of each position, this leads to an expected PL difference of $264. Differences between straddle and strangle results are not dependent on the actual process that generates the underlying returns. Skewed and fat-tailed distributions will create more dramatic results, but the straddle will still have fewer disasters than the strangle.

Instead of showing this by using another postulated distribution, we will look at the returns of the S&P 500 from January 1990 to December 2018. Over this entire period, volatility has been 17.6%, skewness of daily returns has been −0.08, and the excess kurtosis has been 8.9. We sample 252 returns from this population to find the returns of a 1-year straddle and strangle on an imaginary $100 stock. Options are priced at a 17.6% volatility (this approach ignores autocorrelation in the returns so it isn't exactly what would have happened in the real index). To give each strategy the same vega we sell one straddle and 1.68 strangles. The simulation was run 1,000 times. Results are shown in Figures 6.5 and 6.6.

FIGURE 6.5 The returns of the short 100 straddle when the underlying has the S&P 500 return distribution.



FIGURE 6.6 The returns of the short 85/134 strangle (10-delta call and put) when the underlying has the S&P 500 return distribution. Again, the straddle has less downside. This is summarized in Table 6.7. In practice selling a strangle will often collect an implied skewness premium. Because the implied skew overstates the actual skewness of returns, this effect will raise the average profit of the strangle relative to the straddle, but it won't affect the relative risk conclusions. The strangle's win percentage is a very powerful piece of feedback that can trick us into doing trades like this even when they have negative expectation. The straddle has a better correspondence between correctness of forecast and profits. Hence you will be far less likely to fool yourself into thinking you have a volatility edge than you would with a strangle.

This is where many people who sell options “for income” go wrong. There is no magic in selling strangles, even if they are struck a long way out of the money. If you don't have an edge in volatility, you will lose eventually. The straddle has a payoff that is less sensitive either to extreme moves or to making a poor forecast. It won't be profitable as often as the strangle, nor will it practically ever make its theoretical maximum, but it also won't go as badly wrong as a strangle can. By choosing to sell a strangle instead of a straddle, a trader is gaining an increased median return in exchange for greater extreme risks. It is impossible for someone else to say that a choice like this is wrong as it depends on individual risk preferences, but by most risk metrics the straddle might initially appear to be the riskier position, but it really isn't.

Aside: Delta-Hedged Positions This book has focused on trading options from the perspective of speculators and end users. These investors tend not to delta hedge much or at all. However, it is worth repeating the straddle and strangle comparison assuming we hedge daily. Both implied and realized volatilities are 30%, so we again expect an average profit of zero. The results of 10,000 GBM simulations are shown in Figures 6.7 and 6.8 and Table 6.8. It is clear that delta hedging does exactly what it is supposed to do: reduces risk. Extreme results are far more palatable than for unhedged positions. We also see that the differences between straddles and strangles are greatly minimized. The positions are not exactly the same because the strangle will have a more concentrated vega profile (shown in Figure 6.9). This means that when things are going very badly (i.e., the underlying has moved a lot) the straddle risk will start to decrease as we move away from the option strike. This need not happen for strangles. Also note that although the positions were scaled to have the same vega at



initiation, if the stock rallies, the strangle picks up more vega. This increases risk during adverse events.

FIGURE 6.9 Vega as a function of underlying price for the straddle (solid line) and 70/130 strangle (dashed line). Hedging has the effect of reducing the variance of returns, but hedging drastically increases transactions costs and introduces operational issues associated with position monitoring. Most people who are not broker-dealers should probably not be dynamically hedging. For those who are interested, refer to Sinclair (2013) for the theory and practicalities of actively delta hedging.

Butterflies and Condors These are the more conservative versions of straddles and strangles respectively. In each case, exposure to adverse moves is capped. Technically, these strategies are constructed from either



all calls or all puts but in practice traders use the equivalent ironbutterfly and iron-condor structures. These are constructed from out-of-the-money options. Put-call parity means these positions are exactly the same. We repeat the straddle/strangle analysis to compare butterflies to condors. Results are shown in Figures 6.10 through 6.13 and Tables 6.9 through 6.12. (As before, we weight the positions so they have the same vega as a short straddle.)

Because a condor has less vega than a butterfly, we need to trade more of them to get the same volatility exposure. This means that the worst case is slightly worse than with the butterfly. And the condor realizes this worst case 30% of the time. Also, the maximum possible profit is lower than the butterfly's. Now we look at the results where we sell implied volatility at 30% and subsequent realized volatility is 70%. The returns of the butterfly and condor in this scenario are shown in Figures 6.12 and 6.13, and statistics are summarized in Tables 6.11 and 6.12: We can see that the condor has a higher winning percentage, but its wins are capped at the premium of $1,998. This occurred 15% of the time. By having a higher initial premium the butterfly can have larger wins. It wins 12% of the time more than $1,998. The average of these “condor-beating” wins is $3,342. In terms of risk and reward, the butterfly is to the condor what the straddle is to the strangle: lower winning percentage but higher upside and lower downside.

### Aside: Broken Wing Butterflies and Condors

A broken wing fly or condor is one with only one long strike. For example, a broken wing (iron) butterfly might be long an out-ofthe-money put and short a straddle. This has the same payoff as a one- by two-call spread, and we will look at the risks of these in more detail in Chapter Eight. But for now, I want to emphasize that a common reason for implementing these strategies is wrong. It is generally accepted that stock market down moves are more severe than up moves. So, many traders are only concerned with hedging short exposure on the downside. Be careful with this. There isn't much of a difference between daily up moves and down moves. For example, consider daily S&P 500 returns from 1990 through to the end of 2018. Summary statistics of absolute up and down returns are shown in Table 6.13. None of the differences are significant at the 5% level. The difference between the “speed” of breaks and rallies is real, but it is due to correlation effects and is also far smaller than many traders think. It is well known that before 1987, the index option markets had almost no implied volatility skew. After the crash the markets priced in the crash risk. But markets also massively overcompensated. This is both why put options are usually the most overpriced and why, if a trader wants to hedge extreme moves, it is generally best to hedge both extreme drops and extreme rallies.

### Calendar Spread



The calendar spread is used to speculate on relative implied volatility levels. Specifically, we are trying to capture the greater variance premium in the shorter-dated options. For example, we buy the 60-day ATM straddle at an implied volatility of 30% and sell the 30-day ATM straddle at an implied volatility of 40%. We hold the position until the front-month expires, and over this time realized volatility is 30%. Because the edge in this trade comes from the overpriced short-term implied volatility, we also simulate a short 1-month straddle position, which is the most direct way to capture this variance premium. Summary statistics of the PL distributions from simulations of 10,000 paths are shown in Table 6.14. The calendar spread has lower dispersion around the average P/L (which is the same for both positions because it is entirely due to the mispricing of the 1-month implied volatility). At an intuitive level, this is because, at the expiration of the front-month options, the spread's payoff diagram is very similar to the value of a butterfly. This is shown in Figure 6.14, which shows the P/L of the spread.

FIGURE 6.14 The P/L of the straddle spread at expiry of the front-month options. The cost of this risk reduction is that the spread is long vega. If implied volatility drops, the spread will underperform the short straddle. This risk can also be at odds with our volatility forecast. We are projecting that the front-month volatility is too high. This will usually also imply that the second-month volatility is also overpriced (although not by as much). So, the straddle spread is a long vega position that we put on when we are hoping volatility is overpriced. The spread still acts as a diversifier, but we also need to be correct on our view of overall, rather than relative volatility. We demonstrate this problem by simulating a situation in which the realized volatility is 20%. Summary statistics of the spread and the short straddle are shown in Table 6.15. We can reduce this effect by weighting the spread components, so that the overall position is flat vega. This will also reduce the variance reducing properties of the spread. Another weighting scheme is to calculate a volatility beta that relates the change in the front-month volatility to that of the second-month volatility. The market regime in which the benefits of the calendar spread are most obvious is when there is a large variance premium and a low implied volatility.



As always, the trader's decision will depend on exactly what risk he is most concerned about.

Including Implied Volatility Skew The preceding analysis assumed that all strikes had the same implied volatility. Of course, this is generally not the case. Usually, the OTM puts will trade at a volatility premium to the ATM options. Because ATM option-implied volatility is the most predictive of future realized volatility (Bondarenko, 2003; Poon and Granger, 2003, and further references from Chapter Four), by selling OTM puts we can collect a volatility premium. This makes selling strangles relatively more attractive than would be the case in a world where all strikes had the same implied volatility. The shape of the implied volatility curve is fairly persistent. A given delta option's implied volatility will be a constant times the ATM implied volatility. For example, in the SPX the 10 delta put will have an implied volatility about 1.45 times the ATM volatility (Sinclair, 2013). Similarly, the 25 delta call will usually have a volatility of about 0.88 of the ATM volatility. Using this rule of

thumb we can surmise that the 70 strike put (which has a 9 delta) will trade at an implied volatility of 43.5% if the ATM volatility is 30%. Similarly the 130 call (23 delta) will be expected to have an implied volatility of 0.264.

FIGURE 6.15 The profit distribution of a strangle with an implied volatility skew and a fair value for realized volatility. Again assume that future realized volatilities are 30%. If we run the same simulations as previously but price the strangle with more realistic implied volatilities of 43.5% for the put and 26.4% for the call, we get the results shown in Figure 6.15 and Table 6.16. These numbers are better than the strangle when all strikes are priced at a 30% volatility (the results for both situations are shown in Table 6.17 for ease of comparison).

Strike Choice Although straddles are almost always struck at the ATM forward price, the other combinations require us to choose strikes. To do this, start with the short strikes. For straddles and butterflies this will be the ATM strike but for strangles and condors we want to choose strikes that maximize the volatility premium due to the implied volatility curve. The part of the implied volatility curve that is most predictive of the future realized volatility is the ATM, so when we are looking for a volatility edge we should sell a strike with the highest volatility over this value. In pure volatility terms that will almost always be the farthest out-of-the-money put strike. Consider the SPY puts in Table 6.18. The highest implied volatility is in the 210 strike. So let's imagine we sell this option and also sell the 360 call (at an implied

volatility of 11.0%) to create a delta-neutral strangle. We assume that realized volatility was what the ATM predicted (14.2%). We use Monte Carlo to simulate 10,000 instances of this strategy and get the results shown in Table 6.19. We sell $1,000 of vega. However, this combination has very little vega per option. Contrast this with selling the put strike that has the greatest dollar premium over what the option would be worth if it were priced at the ATM implied volatility. Table 6.20 shows this choice.

The greatest dollar premium is in the 260 strike. The market has them worth 6.28, but if they were priced at the ATM volatility, they would only be worth 2.52. Assume we sell 1.2 of the 260/335 strangles so we have the same vega exposure as in the previous simulation. Results are summarized in Table 6.21. The statistics that describe typical results (average, median, percent profitable, and 10th percentile) all favor selling the highest volatility premium. That is to be expected. The edge in selling options comes from selling expensive implied volatility. However, we can also see clearly that when things go wrong, selling teeny options is far more painful than selling those with more premium. In summary, when selling strangles or condors we want to take advantage of the skew premium, but if we do this by selling the option with the highest implied volatility, we expose ourselves to horrendous risk. Once we have found our short put strike, we choose the other call strike to give the delta or vega profile we want.

### Choosing a Hedging Strike



The only reason we choose a short-volatility strategy is that we think implied volatility is too high. Consistent with this, any option we buy will be one that we think is overpriced. This is true even if there is no implied volatility skew. In the presence of a skew we will be overpaying by even more. The long-hedging options have negative expected value. They are a cost of doing business. We want to choose the ones that give us our desired amount of protection for the smallest amount of money. As an example, consider the case in which we sell a 260 put for 6.28 and we don't want a possible loss of more than $5,000. Our possible hedging options are shown in Table 6.22. The process is simple. We just find the hedging strike that gives the loss level we are comfortable with for the lowest cost. Maximum Loss = Profit of Hedge + Loss of Short Put − Hedge Premium + Short Put Premium So here, we would buy the 205 put for a hedge cost of $145. Ignoring option premia, the worst P/L will occur right at the long strike. Here we will have lost money on our short and have got nothing from the long. Below the strike, the long put and short put will cancel completely. Because our loss limit is $5,000 this would put the lower put strike at 210. However, total premia received will be $628 hedge premium, so the strike will be lowered by this amount (divided by 100).

It can be tempting to buy lower premia, shorter-dated options as hedges. This is almost always a bad idea. Generally, the consecutively purchased short-dated options will have a higher total premium than the single longer-dated option (a consequence of total variance scaling with the square root of time). If we also consider the extra transaction costs, the single option becomes even more attractive. We can illustrate this general rule and also show how exceptions to it can occur by using the Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988) approximation. They show that for ATM options the BSM equation is approximated by (6.2) Take this to be our hedging benchmark and compare it to the alternative of buying two options consecutively. In that case, the hedging premium would be (6.3)

The two-option hedge is more expensive if the volatility term structure is flat. However, if the volatility term structure is steep enough, it could be worth rolling the shorter term hedges. Specifically if the volatilities for each subperiod, σ1 and σ2, and the total volatility, σ, are related by (6.4)

then it is worthwhile rolling shorter-dated hedges. As an example, consider the situation in which we can either buy a 2-year option or a 1-year option and then another 1-year option when the first one expires. The stock is $100, the strike is 100, volatility is 30%, and rates are zero. The 2-year put is worth 16.8. Each single 1-year put is worth 11.9. So here the 2-year option is the cheaper alternative.



But consider the case where the 2-year option has an implied volatility of 40% and the 1-year option has an implied volatility of 20%. Also assume that this term structure is constant in time, so when the first 1-year option expires we can buy the next one at 20% as well. Now each 1-year option is worth 8.0 and the 2-year option is worth 22.3. Here, we are better off buying a 1-year option and rolling it later.

Expiration Choice As I've emphasized throughout this chapter, there is more to choosing an option to trade than simply finding the one that has the highest expected return. Many other metrics are also relevant. Median return, drawdown exposure, and percent of trades that are profitable are also statistics to consider. However, it also seems reasonable that our search can start with expected value and expand from there. The purpose of trading is to make money. Risk management should aim to protect expected value rather than minimize risk. The safest position is no position. That will also make no money. The profitability of option trading is driven by the variance premium. Many other effects are important but the variance premium will always be dominant. It is to options what evolution is to biology or what gravity is to physics. So when choosing an expiration our prime consideration is which one has the most variance premium. If we are selling, we want the expiration with the highest premium. If we are buying, we want the expiration with the lowest premium. Israelov and Tummala (2017) studied this problem and wrote a paper whose title is the perfect statement of our issue: “Which Index Options Should You Sell?” By looking at S&P 500 option performances from 1996 to 2015, they showed that short-dated options had the highest variance premia. Their explanation for this was this: Option buyers seek to purchase insurance for their portfolio and are typically concerned about monthly or quarterly returns.… It is intuitive that the options which most directly match these preferences are the most attractively compensated for option sellers. (p. 14)



This is quite possibly true, but I think the more important reason is compensation for risk. Short-dated option risk is dominated by gamma, and long-dated option risk is due to vega. The old story is “vega wounds but gamma kills.” The sellers of short-dated options are taking the most risk and they should be most compensated. A good rule when looking for a variance premium is to look for situations with the most risk. The variance premium is (a mispriced) compensation for risk. The higher the risk, the higher the mispricing. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of Tosi and Ziegler (2017). Using S&P 500 option data from 1996 to 2015 they showed that the returns from shorting out-of-the-money put options were concentrated in the few days preceding their expiration. Backmonth options generated almost no returns. Their proffered reason for this was: The concentration of the option premium at the end of the cycle reflects changes in options' risk characteristics. Specifically, options' convexity risk increases sharply close to maturity, making them more sensitive to jumps in the underlying price. By contrast, volatility risk plays a smaller role close to maturity. (abstract) And conclude: Our results imply that speculators wishing to harvest the put option premium should short front-month options only during the last days of the cycle, while investors wishing to protect against downside risk should use back-month options to reduce hedging costs. (abstract) Other studies that reach the same conclusion are by Andries et al. (2015), Dew-Becker et al. (2014), and van Binsbergen and Koijen (2015).

Conclusion There is no “best” strategy. The choice of what to select is a matter of personal risk preferences. Strangles win more often than straddles but have less upside and more downside. Butterflies and condors are more expensive than straddles and strangles in terms of transaction costs. They will also realize their maximum possible loss a significant amount of the time.

When choosing a short strike, the trader needs to balance receiving the most edge by selling the options with the highest implied volatility and the amount of risk that this produces. Similarly, shorter-dated options will have more variance premium than longer-dated ones but they also have more potential for catastrophe.

Summary Selling OTM option structures (strangles or condors) will give higher median returns and a higher win percentage but this can make it more difficult to distinguish between good trades with expected value and good luck. The highest volatility premium is in short-dated options. Longdated options have very little volatility premium. The highest volatility premium is in far-out-of-the-money puts. Out-of-the-money calls have very little volatility premium.
