CHAPTER 8 Directional Option Strategy Selection In addition to choosing a strike and expiration, the trader needs to decide what strategy to employ. There are many option structures that could be used to speculate directionally, but here we will confine ourselves to those that could be considered the fundamental building blocks of the others: the long call, the long call spread, the short put, the short put spread, and the risk reversal. It is possible to construct a matrix that constructs optimal positions using various risk measures such as the Sharpe ratio, the generalized Sharpe ratio (GSR), or the Kelly ratio. Doing this isn't stupid but here are several problems with the approach: Different criteria will recommend different structures, and none will express the investor's real utility. All the criteria are useful guides, but none are definitive. Often the difference between strategies will be minimal using this method. The various risk ratios assume that our forecasts are correct. It is more important to understand what happens if we are wrong. Although it is possible to calculate derivatives of the ratios (e.g., the derivative of GSR with respect to return), it is more instructive to again run simulations.

Long Stock This is our baseline. We buy 100 shares of a $100 stock. We expect a 20% return and realized volatility is 30%. If our return estimate is correct, the (lognormal) PL distribution after 1-year is shown in Figure 8.1 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.1.

Long Call Consider a long ATM 1-year call on a $100 stock when rates are zero. We expect a 20% return and both implied and realized volatility are 30%. If our return estimate is correct, the PL distribution from a simulation of 10,000 paths is shown in Figure

8.2 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.2. The initial value of the call is $11.92.

leverage relative to the shares and the limited downside. A call option is similar (but not identical) to a long stock position and a stop-loss order at the strike. However, stops will kill some trades that would eventually have recovered. Options won't do this, and this is the benefit of paying the premium.

Long Call Spread We buy the 1-year ATM call and sell the 20-delta call (the 135 strike). The PL distribution from a simulation of 10,000 paths is shown in Figure 8.3 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.3. The initial value of the spread is $9.04. This P/L distribution is similar to a long position with a stop and a profit target. Although returns are far from normal, the extreme values have been eliminated along with the skewness. In indices, it is quite possible that the implied skew means you will be selling the short strike at a discount to the ATM volatility. In many other products, you will receive a premium for the short strike. This changes the initial premium and hence the profits but won't change the shape of the terminal distribution. One benefit that the call spread offers over the call is related to psychology. When holding a call, particularly an OTM call, you are paying for the extreme upside. This means you need to continue to hold the option. A lot of traders have trouble with this (in my experience, amateurs can't take losses and professionals are too inclined to take profits). Instead of fighting this tendency, it may be better to buy a call spread instead of a call. The short strike will be the profit target and the position won't have cost as much to initiate.

### Short Put



We sell the 1-year ATM put. The PL distribution from a simulation of 10,000 paths is shown in Figure 8.4 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.4. The initial value of the put is $11.92. Choosing a short put instead of a long call is really about preferring a high probability of a smaller profit to a larger average profit and positive skewness.

Covered Calls A covered call consists of a long position in a stock and short position in a call on that stock. In exchange for receiving the option premium, the investor has her upside capped. Figure 8.5 shows the covered call payoff at expiration when a 100-strike call option is sold for $5.

FIGURE 8.5 The payoff of the covered call as a function of stock price at expiration. Synthetically a covered call is the same as a short put. Instead of selling a call against an established long stock position, investors sometimes sell a put and hold enough cash to be able to purchase the stock if they are assigned. Synthetically, this position is the same as a covered call with the same strike. However, there are some differences in how and why these strategies are used: Some investors are prohibited from put selling, but they can write covered calls. The chosen strikes tend to be different, with both strategies generally implemented with out-of-the-money options. Selling out-of-the-money put options means the trader usually benefits from selling at an implied volatility premium.



The psychological effects on the trader are also somewhat different. The holder of a covered call tends to be happy with rallies, whereas the seller of the put often feels she has missed out in the case of a large rally. This is because we frame the situations differently. Covered calls are framed as a situation in which we are long and are prepared to sell, whereas short puts are seen as a situation in which we are waiting to get long at a certain price. Part of this is due to the different strike choices but the reasoning is still specious. This shouldn't be a relevant consideration in strategy selection, but in practice it is. Covered calls have been popular with retail traders due to the argument that “I would sell the stock if it went to the strike price, so why not get paid to do that?” This reasoning is poor, but covered calls are also the rare example of a popular retail strategy that works well and makes good sense. Over time they have delivered equity-like returns with lower risk. For example, consider the CBOE BuyWrite Index. This consists of holding the SPX portfolio and selling slightly out-of-the-money 1-month calls that are held until expiration. The performance is shown in Figure 8.6 and summarized in Table 8.5, together with the S&P 500 (including dividends). We can see that the outperformance of the covered call strategy is robust with respect to the exact implementation by looking at the results of BXY (which sells 2% out of the money calls) and BXMD (which sells 30-delta calls). These results are summarized in Table 8.6.

Components of Covered Call Profits The discussion of strike choice up until now has only focused on the risk characteristics of the options. We also need to consider the factors that drive option returns when making the choice. As an example, we consider a covered call. This is the simplest possible option position, but this analysis is quite general. The reason that covered calls can provide equity-like returns with lower volatility is that they are exposed to two profitable factors: the equity market risk factor and the volatility premium. Selling a call against an existing position reduces the portfolio's exposure to the stock while adding a short volatility exposure. The lower volatility of a covered call position is due to the diversification that two factor exposures provide. Consider a stock with a current price of $100. We assume that the stock increases by 10% a year and has a volatility of 15%. We also assume that dividends and rates are zero. We sell a 1-year call option with an implied volatility of 20% against this position. This at-the-money covered call has a delta of 0.47 when evaluated at the realized volatility, so it will earn 4.7% from its exposure to the stock's appreciation (to a first approximation). Also, this option has a premium of $7.97 ($2.00 more than it would have been worth at the true realized volatility). So, about 25% of the option premium that the seller collected is harvesting the volatility premium. That is, we expect to gain 2.0% a year from harvesting the short volatility premium. Here the total expected return of the covered call is 6.7%. Although this example has a lower expected return than the stock, it also has lower volatility. Obviously, this theoretical decomposition varies with respect to the volatility premium, and the ex-post return is affected by both realized volatility and return. Also, the strike choice and expiration of the short call determines how much of the profit comes from directional exposure and how much comes from volatility harvesting. First, we look at the decomposition as a function of a strike assuming all strikes have the same variance premium. This is shown in Figure 8.7. We can see that although the equity premium is an increasing function of strike, the volatility premium is peaked at strikes just

above the current stock price. This is where the option's sensitivity to volatility (vega) is greatest, so it is also where exposure to the volatility premium is maximized. Note that if there is no volatility premium, the covered call earns just the stock return multiplied by its delta (the exposure to its underlying equity). This is the most important concept. Selling options only makes sense if a volatility premium exists. Further, if an investor is more confident in the existence of the volatility premium, he should sell options just above the ATM. Conversely, if he is more confident in the equity return, he should sell options that are further out of the money. The fact that different investors have different forecasting abilities means that they will also choose different option structures.

FIGURE 8.7 The total profit of the covered call and how much comes from equity return and volatility premium.

Covered Calls and Fundamentals It is well-known that value stocks, momentum stocks, low-beta stocks, and small-cap stocks tend to be the best performers. So, investors should preferentially own these. Sadly, with the exception of momentum stocks, these classes of equities tend to have the lowest variance premia. This means that the investor has

to choose between better delta performance or better variance performance and make the strike choice accordingly. Again, this choice will depend on the ability of the individual trader. It is also important to note that the variance premium and subsequent stock returns (the two sources of edge) are not completely independent. High-variance premium predicts high future stock returns. This effect has been extensively studied (see, for example, Bollerslev and Zhou, 2007; Bollerslev and Todorov, 2011; Kelly and Jiang, 2014; Bollerslev et al., 2014) and exists for both single stocks and at the index level. This effect is strong enough that it can be used as a timing signal: when the variance premium is high is a good time to enter covered call positions. Some explanations for the effect are very complex but, very simply, stock markets have tended to go up and volatility rises during drops, so, a high-variance premium is correlated with temporary dips.

Short Put Spread We sell the 1-year ATM put and buy the 20-delta put (the 81 strike). The PL distribution from a simulation of 10,000 paths is shown in Figure 8.8 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.7. The initial value of the spread is $8.11. Unfortunately, in most products the long put will have a significantly higher implied volatility than the short ATM option. For example, the S&P 500 20-delta put currently has an implied volatility of about 1.36 times that of the ATM. So, if the ATM volatility is 30%, we would be paying 40.8% for the long 20-delta put. This doesn't greatly change the shape of the distribution but will be a significant drag on profits. This is shown in Table 8.8. For many definitions of conservative, the short spread is the most conservative directional strategy. It has a high winning percentage, a high median, and a capped downside.

Risk Reversal We sell the 1-year 20-delta put and buy the 20-delta call. The PL distribution from a simulation of 10,000 paths is shown in Figure 8.9 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.9. The initial value of the position is a credit of $93.

Although this position has an initial delta of 40, as the stock moves the delta changes. This is reflected in the fact that the maximum profit and losses are practically the same as for a long



stock position. In exceptionally large moves the 20-delta options become 100 delta and the risk reversal mimics a stock position. However, the risk reversal has lower average and median than the stock position. There will be times when the long calls expire worthless even when the stock rallies. The reason the median value is positive is that the position was entered into at a credit. In most markets, we will be benefiting from selling the 20-delta put at an inflated volatility and, at least for indices, we will be buying the 20-delta call at a volatility under that of the ATM. For the S&P 500, the 20-delta call currently has a volatility of about 0.77 of the ATM volatility. Assuming this, the effect on summary statistics is shown in Table 8.10. The fact the position performs better when there is a skew is entirely due to the extra premium we collect. The initial value of this position is a credit of $330. Because we can collect a reasonable premium from this position, we can still buy a teeny put to hedge the downside risk. For example, the implied volatility of a 5-delta index put is usually about 1.7 times the ATM volatility. In this case that gives an implied volatility of 51% and a premium of $1.28 for this teeny put. That reduces the initial credit to $202 and lowers the average and percentile numbers by the same amount. This downside hedged risk reversal is my personal favorite bullish directional position. It has limited downside risk.

It has the potential for large wins. It takes advantage of the skewness premium.

Aside: The Risk Reversal as a Skew Trade As demonstrated, the risk reversal is an effective way to profit from the implied skewness premium. However, despite many views to the contrary, it isn't particularly useful for speculating on the movement of the implied skew itself. Although the implied skew does fluctuate, the size of its moves is dwarfed by the effects of the stock movement and the level of implied volatility. Consider the risk-reversal just discussed. Imagine we are selling the put and buying the call because we think the slope of the skew will flatten. If we think the put volatility ratio to the ATM volatility will drop and the call ratio will increase, we will make a profit of (8.1) Consider a 1-month risk reversal on a $100 stock. The 20-delta put (91 strike) has an implied volatility of 40.8% and the 20-delta call has an implied volatility of 23.1%. We sell the put and buy the call because we expect the skew to flatten. Table 8.11 shows the profits we make on the position for various degrees of flattening. However, the expected daily move of a $100 stock with a volatility of 30% is $1.50. If the stock drops to $98.5, the risk reversal loses $94, and if the stock rallies to $101.5, the risk reversal will make $16. So, an average daily P/L due to the stock's random fluctuations is $55. Even if the implied curve flattens by three volatility points on both the calls and the puts on one day, the skew-related profit will still only be of the order of the delta/gamma P/L. It is exceptionally unlikely that a move will occur on the day after the trade is initiated. This analysis also ignores changes in the level of the volatility curve and the effect of correlations between stock returns and implied skewness. Long163

dated options will have less gamma to cause problems and more vega to make money off implied volatility changes. However, the long-dated implied volatility curves are much more stable than short-dated ones.

It is possible to make money with this trade. The idea of taking advantage of reversion of the implied skew is a sensible one. But the edge from this prediction is likely to be overwhelmed by noise.

Ratio Spreads Although all directional option positions are dependent on volatility, some have a higher dependence than others. Ratio spreads are an extreme example. Although they are often used to speculate on direction, their primary exposure is to volatility. They have the payoff of a broken wing butterfly, something we always think of as primarily a volatility position. We buy the 1-year ATM call and sell two of the 20-delta calls. The PL distribution from a simulation of 10,000 paths is shown in Figure 8.10 and summary statistics are shown in Table 8.12. The initial value of the position is a debit of $749.

As I have emphasized, there are few hard-and-fast rules in option trading, but the version of the ratio spread that is long the one option and short the second is generally best avoided. In terms of finding edge, the trader needs a good prediction of both volatility



and direction. It is difficult to predict either, let alone both. There are better alternatives for both directional and volatility speculation. It is tempting to use the sale of the two options to “finance” the purchase of the one, but this is only done by taking on unlimited risk. If a trader has enough edge (either in volatility or direction) to do a trade at all, she shouldn't be afraid to pay the option premium. There are no free lunches and there are no free option positions. Another reason that is often given for trading a ratio is to short a high implied skew. This is usually done with puts because puts usually have a more pronounced implied skew. By selling the two farther-out-of-the-money options, the trader can short volatility at the higher implied volatility and mitigate the risk with the single long option. This trade has all of the same problems mentioned in the section on trading risk reversals to capture skew, but ratio spreads are an even worse vehicle for trading an idea that isn't very good to start with. If a trader wants to collect the skew premium, the safest way is to sell a put spread rather than possibly offset this by purchasing a call spread. The long put will almost certainly be the option with the highest implied volatility in the structure, but because the short put will still be trading at a volatility premium to the ATM this position is still short implied skew. An effective way to use a ratio spread is to buy the two options and sell the one as a relatively cheap catastrophe hedge. If the options are struck far enough out of the money, the hope is they will only come into play in a huge crash and we will then end up being long vega and net options (the most robust risk control number). This trade is still not a free lunch. If instead of a crash we have a slow move downwards, we can end up short gamma and paying theta, but the bad scenarios are ones that occur slowly so at least we can rebalance. This incurs transaction costs but at least we have a chance to trade. As an example, with SPY 299 on October 23, 2019, we can sell the November 15 266 put for 0.16 and buy two of the 258 puts for 0.10 each. For the same outlay of 0.04 we could have bought the 241 put. Obviously, in almost all situations we will lose the 0.04 premium. The important thing in evaluating these positions isn't the overall probability distribution; it is how we look in the event of a crash. The risk slides for these two positions are shown in

Tables 8.13 and 8.14. On October 23 the ATM volatility was 11.4%. To estimate the relevant implied volatilities for each underlying price level I could use a regression model to find the historical relationship between price and volatility moves. Such a model is useful for normal trading purposes but for estimating tail event parameters it is at best useless and possibly dangerous if it gives a false sense of certainty. Instead I'm going to assign what I think are possible and I hope overly pessimistic volatility numbers. TABLE 8.13 The Risk Slide for the Single 241 Put SPY price change Postulated IV Delta Vega P/L

−30% −20% −10% 120% 80% 30% −0.0 −0.61 −0.47 $2120 $2515 $965 $465 $207 $65

One could argue than in a “small” crash the single teeny put behaves better because it leaves us short delta and long vega, although the P/L superiority is small. However, in severe crashes the ratio spread gives significantly better protection.

Conclusion As with volatility position selection, there is no one “best” strategy when using options to speculate directionally. The most important consideration is probably whether the variance premium is low or

high. This, more than risk preferences, is paramount in deciding to be long or short options. Then the trader can decide on the structure based on preference for winning percentage, maximum profit, and maximum loss, and so on. Finally, strikes can be chosen by considering the risk characteristics discussed in Chapter Seven.

Summary Variance and skew premia are the most important factors even when trading options directionally. Single options have the best correlation between a profit and a successful prediction. Spreads are useful for mitigating the dependency of the trade on the variance premium. The fact they also create a stop (or profit target) is useful as a risk management tool but predicting an underlying's range is probably too hard to do consistently.
