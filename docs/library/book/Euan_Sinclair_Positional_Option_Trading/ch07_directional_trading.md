CHAPTER 7 Directional Option Trading The genius of the BSM model is the idea that the direction of the underlying doesn't matter when pricing an option. But although this methodology leads to an arbitrage-free replication value, it is still possible to trade options to make bets on the underlying direction. If one believes the story of Thales and the olive presses, this was the original point of options. Even now most traders use options directionally. Indeed, many retail traders can only buy options, and directional trading is essentially their only available tactic. In this chapter, I will discuss directional option speculation, starting with the theory of pricing with a directional view and then discussing the choice of strikes, structures, and expirations. All examples will be given in terms of long calls, assuming a bullish bias, but the ideas are trivially generalizable to both puts and short option positions. I'm also going to assume each option is on one share.

Subjective Option Pricing Options offer many advantages over trading the underlying. The main advantage is the ability to speculate on a more nuanced view than just “up or down.” Also, leverage and the possibility of highly skewed payoffs can be useful. However, these all add considerable complexity. Here I'm going to (possibly optimistically) assume that the trader has a valid prediction method for the underlying and show how she should monetize this view. It is never easy to predict the direction of the underlying. But when trading options, it is easy to be right in your prediction of the underlying and still lose money. It is never good to solve the hardest part of a problem and still fail. The simplest directional option trading strategy is to buy a call if you think the underlying will expire above the strike by more than the option premium. This can be kindly characterized as “model-free directional trading” and more realistically as “guessing.” Consider this set of call prices on a $100 stock: Strik Pric e e 8.7 5.6 3.2



Strik Pric e e 1.5 If we know the stock will expire at $120, our strike choice is trivial. Investing $100 in each option would give the following profits: Strik Profit e $187 $257 $369 $567 But the problems with trading are never about optimizing results when predictions are correct. The real issue is how to control risk when we are wrong. If the stock only goes to $106, our profits will be completely different: Strik Profit e $26 $7 −$68 −$100 These extreme differences illustrate the need for a better plan.

A Theory of Subjective Option Pricing The dynamic hedging strategy used in the BSM model removes the need to use a drift parameter. But that isn't to say that we can't include drift in our personal pricing. We won't be in the risk-neutral paradigm anymore and our theoretical values will disagree with market prices, but that is to be expected. If we agreed with market prices, we wouldn't be speculating. BSM showed that the rate of return of the underlying is not relevant for pricing options. But the underlying return obviously does affect the return of the unhedged option. If we have a valuation model that explicitly includes drift, we can use it to compare the theoretical values to market prices and find the most attractive opportunities. Luckily, several pre-BSM pricing models did include the return on the stock. Boness (1962, 1964) found an option pricing model that is functionally the same as BSM but is based in the real, rather than the riskneutral, world. It isn't arbitrage free, but it answers the most important



question a directional speculator has: If she thinks the stock is going up, what option should she buy? Instead of calculating the call value by taking the expectation of the payoff in the risk-neutral world, Boness's result is the expectation in the physical world. With the normal notation: (7.1) (7.2) where (7.3)

### (7.4)

To arrive at this formula, Boness had to make an assumption about returns. He needed to say that the stock return is the rate used to discount the strike in the put-call relationship, that is, all cash flows would be invested in the stock. In the normal derivation of put-call parity, we form a portfolio that is long a put, short a call, and long a share. At expiration this portfolio is worth the strike price, which means the portfolio is currently worth the discounted strike value. Since the middle ages (where the idea was used as the basis for mortgage lending) it has been known that the correct discount factor is the interest rate. Drift is irrelevant. If anything other than the interest rate is used as a discount factor, an arbitrage opportunity exists. Even if we accept that drift is a real phenomenon, it is also reasonable to include an interest rate as an alternative investment opportunity. The stock appreciates at μ and cash is stored at r. It might appear that no investor would operate like this. If μ > r, why would he not invest all money in the stock and ignore the interest rate completely (Boness's model does this)? In reality, people generally do split investments between assets with



different returns and risks. The stock has a higher return but also higher risk, which is reflected in the volatility parameter. It is possible to construct a pricing model that does this with a formal argument from a modified BSM PDE. But this isn't necessary. Our model needs to assume cash is invested at a risk-free interest rate and the forward price of the stock is driven by a (physical world) drift. If we slightly reinterpret some parameters, this model already exists: the generalized BSM prices (European) options when the underlying pays a continuous dividend yield. We use this, and the interest rate, to price options of the forward value of the stock while also assuming that cash flows are discounted at the risk-free rate. Traders use this model now and interpret the dividend yield and interest rate to be (imperfectly known) objective variables. (Note that in practice different traders will have different dividend estimates and marginal rates. This could, and in rare cases does, allow arbitrage.) We turn this into a model that incorporates drift by reinterpreting the dividend yield as a subjective drift estimate. We use our drift estimate to give a subjective estimate of the underlying's forward price. This model will also allow arbitrage, but it will be consistent with our opinions of the real world. The prices of calls in this model are (7.5) where (7.6)

### (7.7)

As with any other pricing variable or parameter, it helps to have a greek to measure the impact of an incorrect estimate. The partial derivative of the subjective option price with respect to the drift is given by



### (7.8)

Now we can derive subjective values for options and see which are most mispriced. In this example, we consider 1-year options on a $100 stock, with a volatility of 30%, a drift of 10%, and zero interest rates. The riskneutral BSM prices and the subjective prices are shown in Table 7.1. As the drift is primarily going to be a delta effect, it should be no surprise that the greatest absolute difference in values is in the lower strikes. If an investor wants to buy a fixed number of options, these might be the best choice, but in this case, it is probably better to just buy the underlying because the discrepancy would be greatest there. The largest percentage edge (“bang for the buck”) is in the highest strikes, so these appear best for a trader who wants to invest a certain dollar amount.

However, this analysis doesn't consider the different risk characteristics of options with different strikes. Now that we have a theoretical model, we can talk about the distribution of subjective option returns (assuming our drift and volatility estimates are correct).

Distribution of Option Returns: Summary Statistics (7.9) (7.10)



is the true probability of expiring in the money, as opposed to the incorrect but frequently stated number, , which is the risk-neutral probability. And the drift is a large determinant of whether an option expires in the money. As an example of the size of the difference, consider a 1-year 110 strike call on a $100 stock, with volatility of 30%, a drift of 10%, and an interest rate of zero. The risk-neutral probability of exercise is 32%, whereas the subjective probability is 45%. At very short timescales the volatility will overwhelm the drift, but in general it is bad to assume that the risk-neutral probabilities are indicative of anything in the real world. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show how N(d4) depends on the drift and how it varies with strike.

FIGURE 7.1 Probability of the 3-month 150 strike call expiring in the money. Stock is $100, volatility is 30%, and rates are zero.

FIGURE 7.2 Probability of the 3-month calls expiring in the money when the return is 20%. Stock is $100, volatility is 30%, and rates are zero.



Chance of Profit = N(d5) (7.11)

Also, by assuming the underlying price is lognormally distributed, we can easily calculate the median intrinsic value and hence profit. (7.12) (7.13) Further, (7.14)

An example is shown in Figure 7.3. It is possible to calculate the moments of the options returns (Ben-Meir and Schiff, 2012; Boyer and Vorkink, 2014; Sinclair and Brooks, 2017), but the equations are complicated and give no real insight. The most important fact is that options have significantly positive skew. It is also important to note that this extreme skewness occurs even when the underlying has normally distributed returns. This skewness is intrinsic to options and is not inherited from skewness of the underlying. If the underlying has nonnormal returns, the effects on the options will be magnified. In this case, there won't be analytic expressions for the option moments and simulations will be necessary to understand the option return moments.

Strike Choice All of the individual risk measurements given above need to be considered. None is sufficient on its own to determine that a particular option is “best.” And this is probably a good thing, because “best” or “optimal” is only optimal with respect to a given criterion, and trading decisions need to be based on more than just one criterion. In the specific case of strike selection (or investment selection in general) it will be impossible to give a single optimal solution. Some problems can't sensibly be solved this way. Think about the question, “What is the best car in the world?” Here, there are many plausible definitions of best. Does best mean fastest? Most luxurious? Safest? Greenest? Cheapest to buy? Cheapest to run? Most reliable? Within each category it is possible to make valid comparisons. A Ferrari is better than a Lamborghini. A Toyota is better than a Geo. But the argument over whether a Ferrari is better than a Toyota is unresolvable, because different car users have different goals and preferences. In some other situations, it is possible to define a clear and unambiguous definition of best. Consider baseball. The goal of a baseball team is to win games. The best player is the one who most helps his team to do this. The individual skills of hitting, throwing, catching, and running are now seen as components of the ability to create wins, rather than unrelated goals in themselves. So here, a statistic that aggregates the component skills by putting them on a consistent scale and converting them into a measure of wins created is very useful. You can then meaningfully compare a powerhitting catcher to a fast, agile shortstop. But this introduces the danger of overreliance on the power of this single statistic. This number will still have



methodological issues, and there will always be sampling problems with the individual component measurements. Even the best composite statistic should be a starting point rather than a definitive answer. Trading is somewhere in between these situations. The goal of making money is absolute but risk is personal, both in terms of how it relates to a given trader's edges and abilities but also in terms of risk tolerances and aversions. It should be obvious that different people have different levels of risk aversion. This could be personal or it could be because of an external mandate. Anyone trading someone else's money will have to conform to the risk preferences of the capital provider. But it is also important to remember that risk depends on the skills of a specific trader. Risk is all of the things outside our control. So, traders with different sources of edge will have different remaining risk factors. If one trader has an edge in volatility prediction and another doesn't, volatility is an edge for the first and a risk to the second. This is true in most of life. For a heart surgeon, doing a bypass is a low-risk operation. For a random person, it would be murder. So, a composite statistic for comparing risk and reward will be useful, but we should also not expect too much of it. The most well-known of these statistics is the Sharpe ratio, the ratio of (excess) return to the volatility of the return. It is also well-known that the Sharpe ratio is not perfect. It has a large sampling error, generally comparable in size to the estimate. It doesn't distinguish between downside and upside volatility. It doesn't take higher-order moments into account at all. These are all problems, but the specific option-related issue is that we will be dealing with heavily skewed returns. (Skew can be a feature, not a bug. Positive skew is a good reason to include long options in a portfolio.) The first work to address this failing was done by Hodges (1998), who showed the nature of the problem with a very simple example. We have two probability distributions, A and B, of excess returns.

Standard deviation Sharpe ratio

Clearly distribution B is better than distribution A. The only difference is that the outcome of 35% has been increased to 45%. But this (good) change has increased the standard deviation more than the return, so the Sharpe ratio of distribution B is lower than that of distribution A. Hodges derived a generalized Sharpe ratio (GSR) for an investor with exponential utility, but it was necessary to know the complete distribution of payoffs to make the calculation. Pézier (2004) applied similar reasoning to create a GSR that only requires the moments of the distribution (see Maillard, 2018, for a full derivation and discussion). His GSR is (7.16)

For normal returns, the GSR reduces to the Sharpe ratio. Positive skewness increases the GSR. Negative skewness lowers the GSR. Any kurtosis lowers the GSR.



Table 7.2 gives the various statistics for different 3-month call options on a $100 stock with a return of 10%. Both realized and implied volatilities are 30% and rates are zero. Each trader needs to choose the strike that most closely matches what they are looking for. This analysis assumes we have paid the correct volatility level for the options. If we pay too much, our results look much worse. Even when trading purely directionally, implied volatility is very important. This is shown in Table 7.3 where we assume that the implied volatility was 30% but realized volatility was only 22% (this roughly corresponds to the typical variance premium). This effect needs to be considered if the implied volatility of the strike under consideration is very different from the ATM volatility. (Interestingly, the GSR of the 120 strike is better than that of the 105, 110, and 115 strikes. This is because of the extreme skew of the results.)

Fundamental Considerations So far, we have assumed our forecast was only of the mean and variance. Sometimes we may have a more complex view. For example, this is



common in the Eurodollar market. Traders tend to forecast in discrete increments; for example, a 25 bp cut has a 40% chance of occurrence, instead of continuous outcomes, that is, a mean return of 5%. In these cases, each strike should be evaluated with a different subjective drift parameter. Although, given the trader's bias toward a certain probability distribution, the analysis will probably confirm only preexisting opinions (opinions in, opinions out). Traders in most other products should be careful to ask themselves if their forecasts of the distribution lead to expected value. It is hard to predict volatility. It is harder to predict return. Predicting the full distribution is probably a manifestation of overconfidence.

Conclusion There is no simple answer to the question, “What strike should I buy?” Basing the decision on maximizing average return, median return, or probability of profit will lead to different answers. And there are many other statistics that could be sensibly considered. It is also quite likely that a trader's criteria will change based on the rest of her portfolio. The decision needs to be made based on personal utility and on a case-by-case basis.

Summary By interpreting the dividend yield term in the generalized BSM model to be a drift parameter we can get subjective option values that depend on return. These prices are not arbitrage free but can be used to derive real-world statistics (as opposed to risk-neutral statistics). Different evaluation criteria will suggest very different “optimal” strikes.
